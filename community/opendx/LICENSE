IBM PUBLIC LICENSE - Open Visualization Data Explorer VERSION 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT").  ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS.

"Contribution" means:
  a) in the case of International Business Machines Corporation
     ("IBM"), the Original Program, and
  b) in the case of each Contributor,
       i)   changes to the Program, and
       ii)  any additions to the Program thatare distributed in
            conjunction with the Program under this Agreement;
     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
     and are distributed by that particular Contributor.
A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was made or added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.  Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean those claims of patents licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by each Contribution that both originates from and is distributed by that particular Contributor, if any, as well as claims of patents licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the Contributor's Contribution whencombined with the Program.

"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and documentation, if any.

"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.

"Recipient" means the entity that receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, distribute,
     publicly display, publicly perform and sublicense the Contribution
     of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
     if any, in source code and object code form.  The patent license
     shall not apply to the combination of the Contribution with any
     other software except that it shall apply to the combination of the
     Contribution and the Program where, at the time the Contribution is
     added, the addition of the Contribution causes the combination of
     the Contribution and the Program to be covered by the Licensed
     Patents.  Nor shall any machine, apparatus or other hardware be
     licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
     Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
     brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
     property rights or otherwise.  As a condition precedent to
     exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
     hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
     property rights needed, if any.  For example, if a third party
     patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
     Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
     before distributing the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
     sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
     the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:

            warranties and conditions, express and implied, including

            such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in
