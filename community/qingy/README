Qingy README

What is qingy?
--------------

Qingy is a replacement for getty. It is using DirectFB to provide a
fast, nice GUI without the overhead of the X Windows System. It allows
the user to log in and start the session of his choice (text console,
gnome, kde, wmaker, ...). Running several X sessions is also
possible. 

How to get qingy?
-----------------

A package is available in the [community] repo. To install:

# pacman -S qingy 

Several extra themes are also available. In [community] repo, there is
an Arch specific theme:

# pacman -S qingy-theme-arch

A package of several various themes is available in AUR:

    * qingy-themes

How to setup qingy?
-------------------

To use qingy, you'll need to edit /etc/inittab.

Replace:

c1:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 vc/1 linux
c2:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 vc/2 linux
c3:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 vc/3 linux
c4:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 vc/4 linux
c5:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 vc/5 linux
c6:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 vc/6 linux 

by:

c1:2345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty1
c2:2345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty2
c3:2345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty3
c4:2345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty4
c5:2345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty5
c6:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty6 linux

Qingy's author suggest to keep agetty on a console (here on console 6)
as a safety measure as qingy is still beta software.

When logging in an X session, qingy doesn't source your profile. The
best solution is to add:
[ -f /etc/profile ] && . /etc/profile
to your ~/.xinitrc and create a .xsession symlink:
ln -s  ~/.xinitrc ~/.xsession
(or source the profiles in your ~/.xsession depending on your setup). Then
login in the 'Your .xsession' session.
Otherwise, add:
[ -f /etc/profile ] && . /etc/profile
to your ~/.bashrc so that the profile will be sourced for each
terminal.


Having problems with your Synaptics touchpad?
---------------------------------------------

Qingy (and quite possibly other DirectFB applicationss) has some
issues using Synaptics touchpad. This can be solved by adding: 

disable-module=linux_input

to /etc/directfbrc. If the file does not exist, create it. This will
enable you to use your touchpad, however some extra functionality like
tapping or tap-dragging might not work.
