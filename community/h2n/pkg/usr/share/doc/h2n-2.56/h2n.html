<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>h2n</B>   translates   <I>/etc/hosts</I>  to  DNS  zone  files  and  creates  BIND
       <I>named.[boot|conf]</I> configuration files.  This tool can be  run  once  or
       many  times.   After  converting your host table to DNS format, you can
       manually maintain the DNS files, or you can maintain the host table and
       run  <B>h2n</B> each time you modify <I>/etc/hosts</I>.  <B>h2n</B> automatically increments
       the serial number in each DNS file when it makes a new one.

       <B>h2n</B> generates files starting with the prefix "db."   These  are  called
       "db  files."   The  domain  data are stored in a file called <I>db.DOMAIN</I>,
       where <I>DOMAIN</I> defaults to the first label in  your  domain  name  (given
       with  the  <B>-d</B>  option).   The  address-to-name data are stored in files
       named <I>db.NET</I>, where <I>NET</I> is a network number (given with the <B>-n</B> option).
       An  email  address of the person responsible for the domain is included
       in the start-of-authority record for the  domain  (given  with  the  <B>-u</B>
       option).

       Each  time  <B>h2n</B>  is  run, it generates the DNS files from scratch.  Any
       changes that were manually made to the DNS files are lost.  If you need
       to  add resource records to a db file generated by <B>h2n</B>, put the records
       in a file prefixed with "spcl." instead of "db."   <B>h2n</B>  will  add  this
       file's  data  by  appending  an  $INCLUDE  directive  to the end of the
       <I>db.DOMAIN</I> or <I>db.NET</I> file.  Top-of-zone, i.e., zone apex, records can be
       added  to the forward-mapping <I>db.DOMAIN</I> file with the <B>-T</B> option instead
       of placing them in a "spcl" file.  If a "spcl" file is present  for  <B>-d</B>
       <I>DOMAIN</I>,  <B>h2n</B>  will  first  read the DNS resource records from the file,
       check them for errors,  and  store  the  information  internally.   The
       "spcl" data is then referenced during subsequent processing of the host
       table to prevent conflicting DNS records from being generated.

       By default, the MX RRset of a host consists of a single MX record  with
       a  weight  of  10 that points to the host itself as the mail exchanger.
       The default MX RRset can be extended by specifying a global set  of  MX
       records  with  the  <B>-m</B> option.  All MX record generation for the domain
       can be suppressed by specifying the <B>-M</B> option.   To  fine-tune  the  MX
       RRset  on a host-by-host basis, the following flags can be specified in
       the comment field of the relevant host table entry:

       [no mx]    Suppress all MX record generation for a host.  This is  use-
                  ful  for  such  devices as printers and networking equipment
                  which do not need mailer information.

       [smtp]     Generate the default self-pointing MX  record  but  suppress
                  the  global MX record(s) from the <B>-m</B> option(s).  In environ-
                  ments that have a network firewall, this can be used to pre-
                  vent  external mail from reaching a host while still provid-
                  ing MX information for the routing of internal mail.

       [no smtp]  Suppress the default self-pointing MX record but include any
                  global  MX  record(s)  from the <B>-m</B> option(s).  Situations in
                  which this can be useful are:

                  *  A host no longer receives mail and its host name can  not
                     become an alias of the replacement mailhost.

                  *  All  mail should first be routed to one or more mail hubs
                     where virus and/or spam filtering can take  place  before
                     being delivered to the host's IP address.

                  Mail for hosts flagged with [no smtp] will instead be routed
                  to the highest-priority mailhost(s) in the set of global  MX
                  records.
                  NOTE: This  flag  requires  that  the  MTA (Message Transfer
                        Agent, e.g., sendmail, postfix, exim, etc.) running on
                        the  target mailhost(s) be configured to either accept
                        mail on behalf of the host having the [no  smtp]  flag
                        or  deliver  mail  to the flagged host's IP address in
                        lieu of the host's suppressed self-pointing MX record.

       Another  comment  section  flag  is  [TTL=<I>num</I>], where <I>num</I> is a specific
       time-to-live value to use for all resource  records  generated  from  a
       hostname  entry  in the host table.  This is useful for setting artifi-
       cially high or low TTL values for individual hosts.   For  example,  if
       you are going to be moving a host to a new IP address, you can use this
       to set a low TTL value such as 900 (seconds).  This limits how long the
       old  IP  address,  aliases,  and/or  MX  records will be cached on non-
       authoritative name servers.  The maximum any client will have  to  wait
       for  the  new  IP  address to be seen would be 15 minutes in this case.
       Time intervals can also appear symbolically as seconds, minutes, hours,
       days, and/or weeks, e.g., [TTL=15M], [TTL=2h30m], etc.

       The  [no  ptr]  flag  is available for situations where it's desired to
       suppress the creation of the reverse-mapping PTR record for a  particu-
       lar  host  table entry.  For example, if secondary A records are needed
       for a particular IP address, the additional names can either  be  added
       via  a "spcl" file or, perhaps more conveniently, entries with the same
       IP address but alternate names can be added to the host table.   Speci-
       fying  the  [no ptr] flag for the secondary entries leaves a single PTR
       record that points to the primary canonical hostname.

       [rafcp] is a comment field flag which causes certain records to be cre-
       ated  or  not  created.   Including [rafcp] in the comment section will
       cause WKS records indicating RAFCP support to be generated for the host
       and  suppress  generation  of all MX records, even those specified with
       the <B>-m</B> option.  This is to support routable AFCP on the TIO-side of  HP
       3000s which use Telnet Express Boxes as front ends.

       Three  additional  comment  field  flags  are  [no  <B>-c</B>],  [mh=...]  and
       [rp=...].  They correspond to and are documented in the sections  deal-
       ing with the <B>-c</B>, <B>+m</B>, and <B>-r</B> options, respectively.

       By  default,  <B>h2n</B> creates a BIND 4 boot file, <I>./named.boot</I> (<B>-b</B> option),
       and a BIND 8/9 configuration file, <I>./named.conf</I> (<B>+c</B> option).  Files for
       caching-only  name  servers,  <I>./[boot|conf].cacheonly</I>, are also created
       unless they already exist.  If either of the <B>-z</B> or <B>-Z</B> options are used,
       <B>h2n</B>   creates   a   boot/conf  file  called  <I>./[boot|conf].sec.save</I>  or
       <I>./[boot|conf].sec</I>, respectively, for a slave  name  server.   <B>h2n</B>  will
       also  look for the following files and, if found, append their contents
       to the appropriate boot/conf files:

           ./spcl-boot or ./spcl-conf
           ./spcl-boot.sec or ./spcl-conf.sec
           ./spcl-boot.sec.save or ./spcl-conf.sec.save

       It is also possible to prepend site-specific configuration data such as
       ACL definitions to BIND 8/9 conf files with the <B>+C</B> option.

       When <B>h2n</B> starts, it will look for a special configuration file in which
       host-specific network connectivity information can be entered  to  help
       <B>h2n</B>  operate more efficiently in your environment.  The filename search
       paths are:

           $HOME/.h2nrc
           ./h2n.conf
           /etc/h2n.conf
           /etc/opt/h2n/h2n.conf
           /usr/local/etc/h2n.conf

       In addition to  host-specific  network  information,  <B>h2n</B>  command-line
       options  can  be included as a way to customize various default values.
       For more detailed documentation, refer  to  the  sample  <I>h2n.conf</I>  file
       which is included in the <B>h2n</B> distribution.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-a</B> <I>NET[:NETMASK|/CIDR</I> <I>[mode=S]]</I> <I>...</I>
            Add  information  about hosts from network <I>NET</I> to the <B>-d</B> <I>DOMAIN</I> db
            file.  This is similar to the <B>-n</B> option, but no PTR data is gener-
            ated,  i.e.,  no  <I>db.NET</I>  file  is  created.   This is useful when
            another server is responsible  for  address-to-name  mapping,  but
            this  server  is  responsible  for  name-to-address mapping.  <I>CIDR</I>
            sizes /8 to /32 are allowed with  the  default  being  /24  unless
            overridden by a previous <B>-N</B> option.  If <I>NET</I> is a supernet sized /8
            to /24 (class A, B, or C) under which smaller networks  (class  B,
            C, or sub-C) are delegated, the <I>mode=S</I> argument allows those dele-
            gated subnets to be specified in subsequent <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> options (see the
            <B>+S</B>  option  for details).  Including multiple <I>NET</I> arguments and/or
            <B>-a</B> options is allowed.

            <B>Example:</B>
                <B>-a</B> 192.249.249  15.15.16:255.255.248.0  15.0.48/21

       <B>-A</B>   Don't create name server data for aliases in the host table.

       <B>-b</B> <I>BOOTFILE</I>
            Use <I>BOOTFILE</I> (BIND 4) instead of the default: <I>./named.boot</I>.

       <B>-B</B> <I>PATH</I>
            Sets  the  directory  where  boot/conf  files  will   be   written
            (<I>named.[boot|conf]</I>,  <I>[boot|conf].sec</I>  and/or <I>[boot|conf].sec.save</I>,
            and <I>[boot|conf].cacheonly</I>).  You must specify  an  absolute  path-
            name.

       <B>-c</B> <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> <I>[mode=[A][I][D[Q]]]</I> <I>...</I>
            Create  CNAME  records  in the default domain for all the hosts in
            <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I>.  These CNAME records are generated before any other
            data  in  the  default  <I>DOMAIN</I> specified in the <B>-d</B> option, i.e, RR
            name conflicts favor the <B>-c</B> <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> over the default <I>DOMAIN</I>.
            Also,  CNAME  records  are  only  generated for canonical names in
            <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> - aliases are ignored.  This default behavior can be
            overridden by including one or more of the following <I>mode=</I> flags:

            <I>A</I>  Create additional CNAMEs for aliases in <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I>.

            <I>I</I>  Declare  <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I>  to be an intra-zone subdomain of the <B>-d</B>
               option <I>DOMAIN</I>, e.g., <B>-c</B> actor.movie.edu   <I>mode=I</I>  implies  that
               there  are  no  NS  records in the movie.edu zone that delegate
               actor.movie.edu to a child zone.  The subdomain "actor" is just
               another  DNS  label  that  a host within the movie.edu zone may
               have as part of its  domain  name.   The  resulting  intra-zone
               CNAME would be:

                   host.movie.edu.   CNAME   host.actor.movie.edu.

               After  the  CNAME is generated or registered, normal processing
               of the host table entry continues. i.e., A, PTR, and other  RRs
               are generated as necessary.

            <I>D</I>  Defer  creation of CNAMEs, i.e., RR names in the default <I>DOMAIN</I>
               takes precedence over naming conflicts in the <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I>.

            <I>Q</I>  Do not issue a warning message when a deferred CNAME can not be
               created  due to a naming conflict in the default <I>DOMAIN</I>.  Valid
               only when the <I>D</I> flag is also specified.

            Including multiple <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> arguments and/or  <B>-c</B>  options  is
            allowed.   The  <B>-c</B> option can be effectively canceled for any host
            by including the [no <B>-c</B>] flag in its host table comment field.
            NOTE: The collection of <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> names is sorted so that sub-
                  domains within a domain tree are matched before their parent
                  domains, i.e., the most specific domain matches  before  the
                  least  specific  one.  If a <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> is a parent domain
                  of the <B>-d</B> option <I>DOMAIN</I>, an exception is  made  and  the  <B>-c</B>
                  option is NOT matched for host table entries matching the <B>-d</B>
                  <I>DOMAIN</I>.

       <B>+c</B> <I>[CONFFILE]</I> <I>[mode=S|M]</I>
            Use <I>CONFFILE</I> (BIND 8/9) instead of the default:  <I>./named.conf</I>  The
            following optional <I>mode=</I> arguments are recognized:

            <I>S</I>  Create  <I>CONFFILE</I>  with  zone  statements in single-line format.
               This is the default.

            <I>M</I>  Create <I>CONFFILE</I> with zone statements  in  multi-line,  indented
               format.

       <B>-C</B> <I>COMMENT-FILE</I>
            Create  resource  records  by using keys in the host table comment
            field  as  indices  into  <I>COMMENT-FILE</I>.    <I>COMMENT-FILE</I>   contains
            "key:resource record" pairs, e.g.,

                B1000:IN HINFO hp9000-B1000 hp-ux

            When <B>h2n</B> encounters "B1000" in the comment section of the host ta-
            ble, it creates a resource record by replacing the  "B1000:"  with
            the host's canonical name.

       <B>+C</B> <I>PRE-CONFFILE</I>
            Prepend  the  contents of <I>PRE-CONFFILE</I> to the BIND 8/9 <I>CONFFILE</I> of
            the <B>+c</B> option.  Useful for holding ACLs, logging specifications as
            an  alternative  to the <B>+L</B> option, and/or option specifications if
            the <B>+O</B> option is used without an argument.

       <B>-d</B> <I>DOMAIN</I> <I>[db=FILE1]</I> <I>[spcl=FILE2]</I> <I>[mode=D]</I>
            Your domain name is <I>DOMAIN</I>.  Use the <I>db=</I> and/or <I>spcl=</I> arguments to
            override  the  default  filenames of <I>db.LABEL</I> and <I>spcl.LABEL</I> where
            LABEL is the first label of <I>DOMAIN</I>,  e.g.,  label.movie.edu.   Use
            the  <I>mode=D</I>  argument  to  set  the  default domain of unqualified
            canonical host names in the hostfile to <I>DOMAIN</I>.

       <B>-e</B> <I>EXCLUDED-DOMAIN</I> <I>...</I>
            Exclude data from the  hostfile  with  names  in  <I>EXCLUDED-DOMAIN</I>.
            Specifying multiple <I>EXCLUDED-DOMAIN</I> arguments and/or <B>-e</B> options is
            allowed.
            NOTE: The collection of <I>EXCLUDED-DOMAIN</I>s is sorted  so  that  only
                  the most top-level domain of a domain tree is kept since its
                  subdomains are essentially redundant in  this  context.   If
                  any <I>EXCLUDED-DOMAIN</I> is the parent of the <I>DOMAIN</I> specified in
                  the <B>-d</B> option and/or a <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> of the  <B>-c</B>/<B>-p</B>  options,
                  an  exception is made and the <I>DOMAIN</I> or <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> is NOT
                  excluded.

       <B>-f</B> <I>FILE</I>
            Command line options are read  from  a  file  called  <I>FILE</I>.   This
            option  cannot  be used within <I>FILE</I>.  Comments are allowed in <I>FILE</I>
            using the same style as in the host table or DNS  database  files,
            i.e.,  comments start after an unquoted "#" or ";" and continue to
            the end of the line.  The quoting characters ["'\] can be used  to
            quote  whitespace and are parsed using rules similar to the shell.

       <B>-h</B> <I>HOST</I>
            Set <I>HOST</I> in the MNAME  (master  name  server)  field  of  the  SOA
            record.  The default is the host on which you run <B>h2n</B>.

       <B>-H</B> <I>HOSTFILE</I>
            Use <I>HOSTFILE</I> instead of <I>/etc/hosts</I>.

       <B>-i</B> <I>NUM</I>
            Set the SOA serial number of all created zones to <I>NUM</I>.

            NOTE: Serial number changes comply with the wrap-around arithmetic
                  specified by RFC-1982.  Setting the <B>-i</B> option may require  a
                  subsequent  run  by <B>h2n</B> before <I>NUM</I> appears as the SOA serial
                  number.

       <B>-I</B> <I>[ignore|warn|audit|audit-only|warn-strict|fail|strict]</I> <I>[rfc2782]</I>
            Controls the level of checking done on hostnames  for  conformance
            to  naming  standards established by RFC-952 and RFC-1123.  The <B>-I</B>
            option accepts one of the following arguments  which  are  ordered
            such  that  each subsequent argument includes the functionality of
            the preceding one:

            <I>ignore</I>   Disables name checking and zone data auditing.

            <I>warn</I>     Issues a warning about hostnames and domain names that do
                     not conform to RFC-952 and RFC-1123.
                     NOTE: Hostname  aliases that generate a CNAME record type
                           (the most common case) are generally not subject to
                           the restrictions of these two RFCs.  This flexibil-
                           ity of alias names allows the  preservation  of  an
                           otherwise  illegal  hostname by making it become an
                           alias instead.

            <I>audit</I>    Issues a warning about <B>-h</B>/<B>-s</B>/<B>-S</B>/<B>-m</B> options that point  to
                     CNAMEs  or  nonexistent  domain  names.   If "spcl" files
                     exist, the same checks are also done with  NS,  MX,  SRV,
                     PTR, AFSDB, and RT records as well as checks for dangling
                     CNAMEs and RP records with missing  TXT  records.   Dele-
                     gated  subdomains  are  checked  for  having at least two
                     listed name servers, no missing glue records, no non-glue
                     records at or below zone cuts, and NS RRsets with consis-
                     tent TTL values.  This is the default setting.

            <I>audit-only</I>
                     Same as <I>audit</I> but excludes the name checking of the  <I>warn</I>
                     argument.

            <I>warn-strict</I>
                     Extends  conformance  checking to the RFC-952 requirement
                     that hostnames and their aliases in the host table be  at
                     least two characters in length.  Includes <I>audit</I>.

            <I>fail</I>     Performs  the same level of checking as the <I>warn</I> argument
                     except  that  non-compliant  hostnames  and  aliases  are
                     rejected.  Includes <I>audit</I>.

            <I>strict</I>   Performs  the  same  level of checking as the <I>warn-strict</I>
                     argument except that non-compliant hostnames and  aliases
                     are rejected.  Includes <I>audit</I>.

            <I>rfc2782</I>  May  be specified independently of the above arguments to
                     check for the presence  of  "_service._protocol"  as  the
                     leading labels in the owner names of SRV records.

            Operators  of  BIND  4/8  name  servers that are configured with a
            "check-names" option setting of "fail" should run <B>h2n</B> with the  <B>-I</B>
            <I>fail</I> option as well.

       <B>-L</B> <I>NUM</I>
            Explicitly use a file handle limit of <I>NUM</I> when generating database
            files.  Default value is 120.

       <B>+L</B> <I>[LOG-SPEC]</I>
            Add a logging  specification  to  the  config  files  (<I>named.conf</I>,
            <I>conf.sec</I>,  <I>conf.sec.save</I>).   If  you only specify <B>+L</B>, you'll get a
            simple logging specification that will eliminate a  lot  of  bogus
            information  that  would  otherwise  fill up your syslog.  You can
            override this by giving your own entries, e.g.,

                <B>+L</B> category lame-servers { null; };

            For each <B>+L</B> <I>LOG-SPEC</I> option that is specified, a  line  containing
            the <I>LOG-SPEC</I> is added in the config file, thus including more than
            one <B>+L</B> option is allowed.  Omitting this option will also omit any
            logging specification from appearing in the config files.  See the
            <B>named</B> man page for valid logging options.

       <B>-m</B> <I>WEIGHT:MX-HOST</I> <I>...</I>
            Include an MX record that points to <I>MX-HOST</I>  at  <I>WEIGHT</I>  for  each
            host  in your domain which has neither the [no mx] nor [smtp] com-
            ment field flags.   Including  multiple  <I>WEIGHT:MX-HOST</I>  arguments
            and/or <B>-m</B> options is allowed.

            <B>Example:</B>

       <B>+m</B> <I>[D|C|P|CP]</I>
            Controls  the  method by which DNS records get generated for hosts
            with multiple addresses.  By default, the canonical name  of  such
            multi-homed  hosts  is  assigned  an  A  record  for each address.
            Aliases unique to one address  are  also  assigned  an  A  record.
            Aliases  common to all addresses are assigned a CNAME record.  The
            PTR record for each address points to the multi-address  canonical
            name.   This  default behavior can be overridden by specifying one
            of the following flags:

            <I>D</I>  Same as the default behavior.

            <I>C</I>  The first alias unique to one address is still  assigned  an  A
               record  but  subsequent  aliases  unique  to  the  address  are
               assigned CNAME records which point to the first alias.

            <I>P</I>  PTR records do not point to the  multi-address  canonical  name
               but  instead point to the first alias having an A record, i.e.,
               the unique name of the specific network interface.

            Combining the <I>C</I> and <I>P</I> flags is allowed.  These  global  specifica-
            tions  can  be  overridden for any host by including the analogous
            [mh=d|c|p|cp] flag in its host table comment field.

       <B>-M</B>   Don't generate MX records.

       <B>-n</B> <I>NET[:NETMASK|/CIDR</I> <I>[mode=S]</I> <I>[domain=NETDOMAIN]</I> <I>[ptr-owner=TEMPLATE]]</I>
            Add information about hosts from network <I>NET</I> to the <B>-d</B>  <I>DOMAIN</I>  db
            file.  <I>CIDR</I> sizes /8 to /32 are allowed with the default being /24
            unless overridden by a previous <B>-N</B>  option.   For  <I>CIDR</I>  sizes  /8
            through  /24, PTR data is written to the corresponding <I>db.NET</I> file
            in the "in-addr.arpa" domain.  Specifying a <I>CIDR</I> size of /8, e.g.,
            <B>-n</B>  <I>NET</I>/8,  will  cause PTR data to be written to a single class-A
            <I>db.NET</I> file.  <I>CIDR</I> sizes 9 through 16 will  cause  the  equivalent
            number  of  class-B  <I>db.NET</I>  files  to  be created.  <I>CIDR</I> sizes 17
            through 24 will cause the  equivalent  number  of  class-C  <I>db.NET</I>
            files  to be created.  If <I>NET</I> is a supernet sized /8 to /24 (class
            A, B, or C) under which smaller networks (class B,  C,  or  sub-C)
            are  delegated, the <I>mode=S</I> argument allows those delegated subnets
            to be specified in subsequent <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> options (see the <B>+S</B> option for
            details).   For sub-class-C networks, i.e., <I>CIDR</I> sizes /25 through
            /32, refer to the following sections that explain the <I>domain=</I>  and
            <I>ptr-owner=</I> arguments for details regarding various default values.
            Including multiple <I>NET</I> arguments and/or <B>-n</B> options is allowed.

            <I>domain=NETDOMAIN</I> (for <I>NET</I>/25 to <I>NET</I>/32 only)
                Specifies that the PTR records are to reside in the  DNS  zone
                <I>NETDOMAIN</I>.   If  omitted,  <I>NETDOMAIN</I>  defaults  to  the naming
                scheme illustrated by the following examples:

                    192.168.4.0/25  -&gt;  0-127.4.168.192.in-addr.arpa
                    192.168.4.0/26  -&gt;  0-63.4.168.192.in-addr.arpa
                    192.168.4.0/27  -&gt;  0-31.4.168.192.in-addr.arpa
                    192.168.4.0/28  -&gt;  0-15.4.168.192.in-addr.arpa
                    192.168.4.0/29  -&gt;  0-7.4.168.192.in-addr.arpa

                    192.168.4.0/32  -&gt;  0.4.168.192.in-addr.arpa

                The default reverse-mapping db  files  that  <B>h2n</B>  creates  are
                named according to the following pattern:

                    192.168.4.0/25  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0-127</I>
                    192.168.4.0/26  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0-63</I>
                    192.168.4.0/27  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0-31</I>
                    192.168.4.0/28  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0-15</I>
                    192.168.4.0/29  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0-7</I>
                    192.168.4.0/30  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0-3</I>
                    192.168.4.0/31  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0-1</I>
                    192.168.4.0/32  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0</I>

                Special  characters  that  are  are valid in a domain name but
                troublesome in filenames will get translated to the "%"  char-
                acter in the db files, e.g.,

                    domain=0/28.4.168.192.in-addr.arpa  -&gt;  <I>db.192.168.4.0%28</I>

                PTR  records  can  even  be  written to the forwarding-mapping
                <I>DOMAIN</I> in the <B>-d</B> option, i.e., <I>domain=DOMAIN</I>, as long  as  the
                <B>-d</B> option precedes the <B>-n</B> option.  Additional resource records
                can be added to a <I>spcl.NET</I> file where <I>NET</I>  is  suffix  of  the
                corresponding  <I>db.NET</I> file.  <B>h2n</B> will append such "spcl" files
                to their matching "db" files via an $INCLUDE directive.

            <I>ptr-owner=TEMPLATE</I> (for <I>NET</I>/25 to <I>NET</I>/32 only)
                Specifies that <I>TEMPLATE</I> be used  to  build  the  zone-relative
                names  in the owner field of PTR records in the <I>NETDOMAIN</I> zone
                file.  Substitution tokens based upon each octet  of  an  IPv4
                address  are  used to construct the appropriate <I>TEMPLATE</I>.  The
                octet tokens (from left to right) are "$1",  "$2",  "$3",  and
                "$4".   To  illustrate  this  concept, here are the fixed tem-
                plates used by <B>h2n</B> to construct PTR owner names for  class  A,
                B,  and  C  <I>NET</I>s  given  a  host  name  with  an IP address of
                "A.B.C.D":

                If the <I>ptr-owner=</I> argument is omitted,  <I>TEMPLATE</I>  defaults  to
                "$4".  For example, given the following host table:

                    192.168.4.0  drama.movie.edu
                    192.168.4.1  comedy.movie.edu

                    192.168.4.3  cartoon.movie.edu

                and the following RFC-2317 delegation in <I>NET</I>'s parent zone:

                    $ORIGIN 4.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
                    $GENERATE  0-3   $    CNAME   $.0-3

                                          NS      ns2.movie.edu.

                The  following  <B>-n</B>  option  would  generate  the  required PTR
                records in file <I>db.192.168.4.0-3</I>:

                    3     PTR     cartoon.movie.edu.

                To  illustrate  the  flexibility  in   accommodating   various
                RFC-2317  naming  schemes, suppose that the PTR records are to
                be mapped back to the "movie.edu" zone like so:

                    $GENERATE  0-3  $  CNAME  192-168-4-$.movie.edu.

                The following <B>h2n</B> options would  be  needed  to  generate  the

            a subnet mask or <I>CIDR</I> size with <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> overrides the <B>-N</B> subnet mask
            or  size  for  that <I>NET</I> only.  May be specified multiple times for
            different blocks of <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> <I>NET</I>s.  <I>CIDR</I> sizes /8 to /32 are allowed.

       <B>-o</B> <I>[REFRESH]:[RETRY]:[EXPIRE]:[MINIMUM]:[DEFAULT-TTL]</I>
            Change  the  default  SOA values to the values provided.  For name
            servers running versions of BIND prior to 8.2, the default  values
            are  (10800:3600:604800:86400).   For versions 8.2 and later which
            implement  RFC-2308,  the  defaults  are  (3H:1H:1W:10M:1D)   with
            <I>DEFAULT-TTL</I> appearing in a $TTL directive and <I>MINIMUM</I> being seman-
            tically treated as a negative caching value.  <B>h2n</B> will always  try
            to determine the BIND version of the master name server (<B>-h</B> option
            or localhost) and act accordingly.  However, if the  BIND  version
            is  unavailable,  <B>h2n</B>  version 2.40 and later will create RFC-2308
            formatted zone files by default *unless* the <B>-o</B> option  is  speci-
            fied with exactly four explicit and/or placeholder values.
            NOTE: These  built-in default values do not override those in zone
                  files that already exist.  Use the <B>-o</B> option to specify  SOA
                  values  that  will  override those in existing zone files as
                  well as becoming the default  values  for  new  zone  files.
                  Also,  existing  $TTL  directives will force RFC-2308 format
                  unless the detected BIND version is less than 8.2, in  which
                  case the directives will be removed.

            <B>Examples:</B>
                <B>-o</B> ::::12H
                    Generates a "$TTL 12H" directive in all zone files.

                <B>-o</B> :::12H
                    Generates  a  non-RFC-2308  TTL  of 12H in the SOA <I>MINIMUM</I>
                    field of all zone files *if* the detected BIND version  is
                    less than 8.2 or is unavailable.

                <B>-o</B> :::
                    Generates  the  same  non-RFC-2308  format as the previous
                    example but using the built-in default SOA values instead.

       <B>-O</B> <I>OPTION</I> <I>OPTION-ARGS</I>
            Add  a  boot  option  specification to the boot files (<I>named.boot</I>,
            <I>boot.sec</I>, <I>boot.sec.save</I>), e.g.,

                <B>-O</B> options no-round-robin

            See the <B>named</B> man page for valid options.  Including more than one
            <B>-O</B> option is allowed.

       <B>+O</B> <I>[OPTION-SPEC]</I>
            Add   an   option   section  specification  to  the  config  files
            (<I>named.conf</I>, <I>conf.sec</I>, <I>conf.sec.save</I>), e.g.,

                <B>+O</B> round-robin no;

            For each <B>+O</B> <I>OPTION-SPEC</I> option that is specified, a line  contain-
            ing  the  <I>OPTION-SPEC</I>  is added to the config file, thus including
            more than one <B>+O</B> <I>OPTION-SPEC</I> option is allowed.  If you use a sin-
            gle <B>+O</B> option without an argument, the global options section will
            not be generated.  This is useful if you want to maintain  a  main
            <I>named.conf</I>  file  for your master and slaves with a complex mix of
            options  {},  logging  {},  and/or  other  global  sections,   and
            "include" the <B>h2n</B>-generated zone sections.  Combine this with a <B>+c</B>
            option.

       <B>+om</B> <I>OPTION</I> <I>OPTIONS-ARGS</I>
            Adds a zone-specific option to the config file (<I>named.conf</I>), e.g.,

                <B>+om</B> also-notify { 15.1.2.3; 15.1.2.4; };

            This option is position dependent and applies to the last <B>-d</B> or <B>-n</B>
            option specified, however, if a <B>+om</B> option appears before  any  <B>-d</B>
            or  <B>-n</B>  options  it  is assumed that the <B>+om</B> option applies to all
            zones.  Thus, it will be added to each zone section in the  config
            file.  Including multiple <I>OPTION</I>/<I>OPTION-ARGS</I> argument pairs and/or
            <B>+om</B> options is allowed.

       <B>+os</B> <I>OPTION</I> <I>OPTIONS-ARGS</I>
            Adds a zone-specific option to the config files  (<I>conf.sec</I>  and/or
            <I>conf.sec.save</I>), e.g.,

                <B>+os</B> max-transfer-time-in 60;

            Like  the  <B>+om</B> option, it is position dependent and applies to the
            last <B>-d</B> or <B>-n</B> option specified.  Also, if  a  <B>+os</B>  option  appears
            before  any <B>-d</B> or <B>-n</B> options it is assumed that the <B>+os</B> applies to
            all zones.  Including multiple <I>OPTION</I>/<I>OPTION-ARGS</I>  argument  pairs
            and/or <B>+os</B> options is allowed.

       <B>-p</B> <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> <I>[mode=A|P]</I>
            Create  only  PTR data for hosts in <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I>.  This is useful
            when a different server is responsible for the  forward  (name-to-
            address)   mapping  data  of  <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I>  but  this  server  is
            responsible for the reverse (address-to-name) mapping data of each
            <B>-n</B>  option.   Including multiple <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> arguments and/or <B>-p</B>
            options is allowed.  Each <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> may need a <I>mode=</I>  argument
            with one of the following flags:

            <I>A</I>  Required  for  each <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> which had its forward mapping
               data built with the <B>h2n</B> <B>-A</B> option  in  effect.   This  prevents
               dangling PTR records from being generated for multi-homed hosts
               in <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> having the [mh=p] or [mh=cp] flag in the  com-
               ment  field  of  the  host  table.  Can also be specified as an
               override flag for <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> when the  <B>+m</B>  <I>P</I>  option  is  in
               effect.

            <I>P</I>  Enables  the  alternate  method  of  PTR  record generation for
               multi-homed hosts in <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> as previously described  for
               the <B>+m</B> <I>P</I> option when that option is not in effect.  This method
               is overridden for any host in <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> having  the  [mh=d]
               or [mh=c] flag in its comment field.

            NOTE: The collection of <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> names is sorted so that sub-
                  domains within a domain tree are matched before their parent
                  domains,  i.e.,  the most specific domain matches before the
                  least specific one.  If a <I>REMOTE-DOMAIN</I> is a  parent  domain
                  of  the  <B>-d</B>  option  <I>DOMAIN</I>, an exception is made and the <B>-p</B>
                  option is NOT matched for host table entries matching the <B>-d</B>
                  <I>DOMAIN</I>.

       <B>-P</B>   Preserve upper-case characters of hostnames and aliases.  Requires
            the "Tie::CPHash" Perl module to be available.

       <B>-q</B>   Work quietly.

       <B>-r</B>   Enable creation of RP  (Responsible  Person)  records.   Look  for
            strings  in  the  comment  fields  of  the  host  table that match
            [rp=<I>mail-addr</I>[ <I>text</I>]], where <I>mail-addr</I> is a usual  e-mail  address
            specification,  and  (optionally)  <I>text</I> is a free-form text string
            (usually containing a phone number and/or pager number,  or  other
            info).  This construct is converted to an RP record containing the
            e-mail address, and if <I>text</I> is present, a TXT record is also added
            containing <I>text</I> (with the RP record referencing the TXT record).

       <B>-s</B> <I>SERVER</I> <I>...</I>
            List <I>SERVER</I> for all zones.  Adds NS records for the zone(s) corre-
            sponding to the <B>-d</B> option and all <B>-n</B> options.  Including  multiple
            <I>SERVER</I> arguments and/or <B>-s</B> options is allowed.

       <B>-S</B> <I>SERVER</I> <I>...</I>
            List <I>SERVER</I> for specific zone(s).  Adds NS records for the zone(s)
            corresponding to the last preceding <B>-d</B> or <B>-n</B> option  (this  option
            is  position  dependent).   There  can  be  multiple zones if this
            applies to a  <B>-n</B>  option.   Including  multiple  <I>SERVER</I>  arguments
            and/or <B>-S</B> options is allowed.

       <B>+S</B> <I>[enable|disable]</I>
            Control  the ability of class A, B, or C <I>NET</I>s to act as supernets,
            i.e., parent networks, for subsequent <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> options which  specify
            a  sub<I>NET</I> of a smaller class (B, C, or sub-C).  When <B>h2n</B> reads its
            option list, each <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> <I>NET</I> is checked to see if has any  overlap-
            ping  IP  addresses with a previously-specified <I>NET</I>.  If an inter-
            class overlap exists, the default behavior is to treat the  situa-
            tion as an ambiguous data entry error, e.g.,

                -n 192.168/16
                -a 192.168.1/24
                Improper -a option (-a 192.168.1/24).
                It overlaps with a network of a different class from a
                previous option:
                  -n 192.168/16
                They can't simultaneously specify a part of the same DNS
                address-to-name space.

            However,  the  overlapping  <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> options in the preceding example
            are exactly what is needed in the scenario where:

                1. The file "spcl.192.168" exists and contains NS records
                   which delegate the reverse-mapping name space for
                   192.168.1/24 to other name servers.  Remember that
                   any <I>spcl.NET</I> file that <B>h2n</B> finds is appended to
                   the appropriate <I>db.NET</I> file that gets created.

                2. The host table being used has entries for both parent
                   (192.168/16) and delegated (192.168.1/24) networks.

            When inter-class network overlaps need to exist as  <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B>  options
            to  accommodate reverse-mapping delegations, the <B>+S</B> option must be
            specified so that the appropriate supernet(s) can be recognized as
            such.   In  the  current  example, specifically assigning supernet
            status  to  the  192.168/16  network  prevents   the   overlapping
            192.168.1/24  network  from being rejected when the option list is
            processed.  The <B>-a</B> option is then able to match  IP  addresses  in
            the  192.168.1/24  network  and  prevent  their  corresponding PTR
            record(s) from being matched and created in  the  db.192.168  zone
            data file, e.g.,

                <B>+S</B>
                -n 192.168/16
                <B>+S</B> <I>disable</I>
                -a 192.168.1/24

            Once the <B>+S</B> option is specified, all subsequent class A, B, and/or
            C <I>NET</I>s declared with the <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> options are considered to be super-
            nets relative to any smaller-classed sub<I>NET</I> until cancelled by the
            <B>+S</B> <I>disable</I> option.  Multiple <B>+S</B> <I>enable</I>/<I>disable</I> blocks may be used.

            As  mentioned  in  the descriptions for the <B>-n</B> and <B>-a</B> options, the
            <I>mode=S</I> argument may also be used as an alternate way to declare an
            individual <I>NET</I> to be supernet, e.g.,

                -n 192.168/16  <I>mode=S</I>
                -a 192.168.1/24

            NOTE: <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B>  options that are declared to be supernets must appear
                  before the corresponding <B>-n</B>/<B>-a</B> options for  the  overlapping
                  subnets  since <B>h2n</B> processes these options in a single pass.
                  Also, care should be taken  not  to  overuse  the  <B>+S</B>/<I>mode=S</I>
                  supernetting  feature.   Doing  so prevents the detection of
                  unintended network overlaps.

       <B>-t</B>   Generate TXT records from the host  table  comment  section.   Any
            special <B>h2n</B> processing flags are ignored, e.g., [no smtp].

       <B>+t</B> <I>DEFAULT-TTL</I> <I>[MINIMUM-TTL]</I>
            Create  an  RFC-2308  $TTL directive at the top of all zone files.
            If the <I>MINIMUM-TTL</I> argument is specified, use that as the negative
            caching interval instead of the default value of 10 minutes.

       <B>-T</B> <I>[mode=M]</I> <I>[RR='DNS</I> <I>RR'</I> <I>[RR='...']]</I> <I>[ALIAS='NAME</I> <I>[TTL]']</I> <I>...</I>
            Add  additional  top-of-zone-related  records  to <I>DOMAIN</I> of the <B>-d</B>
            option as an alternative to creating them in a "spcl"  file.   The
            following arguments are recognized:

            <I>mode=M</I>  Add the global MX record set from the <B>-m</B> option(s).

            <I>RR=</I>     Add '<I>DNS</I> <I>RR</I>' with the owner field set to whitespace or the
                    RFC-1035 "@" symbol.  Any DNS record type that is  contex-
                    tually  valid  in  the  zone  apex  can be specified.  The
                    appropriate quotes must enclose '<I>DNS</I> <I>RR</I>' with its embedded
                    whitespace to capture it as a single argument.

            <I>ALIAS=</I>  Add  a  CNAME  having <I>NAME</I> in the owner field which has an
                    RDATA field that points to "@",  the  zone  apex.   If  an
                    optional <I>TTL</I> is specified, the '<I>NAME</I> <I>TTL</I>' argument must be
                    enclosed in the appropriate quotes.

            Including multiple <I>RR=</I> and/or <I>ALIAS=</I> arguments and/or  <B>-T</B>  options
            is allowed.

       <B>-u</B> <I>CONTACT</I>
            Set  <I>CONTACT</I>  as the e-mail address in the RNAME (responsible per-
            son) field of the SOA record.  <I>CONTACT</I> should be a  complete  mail
            address, e.g.,

                hostmaster@movie.edu

            Defaults to root@<I>DOMAIN</I> (<B>-d</B> option).  Periods in the username-por-
            tion of the address, e.g.,

                Sam.Spade@movie.edu

            will be escaped if necessary.
            NOTE: If <I>CONTACT</I> lacks the "@" symbol and has a  trailing  period,
                  RNAME format will be assumed and <I>CONTACT</I> left unchanged.

       <B>-v</B>   Display the version number of <B>h2n</B>.

       <B>-V</B> <I>DOMAIN</I>
            Verify the integrity of a domain by performing a zone transfer and
            analyzing the data.  All of the checks described above for the  <B>-I</B>
            <I>audit</I>  option  are  done  plus  those  for  "CNAME and other data"
            errors.  In addition, listed name servers are checked  for  proper
            delegation.  Including multiple <I>DOMAIN</I> arguments and/or <B>-V</B> options
            is allowed.

       <B>-w</B>   Generate WKS records that list the SMTP service over the TCP  pro-
            tocol if an MX record is also created.

       <B>-W</B> <I>PATH</I>
            Sets  the  directory  where db files will be located on the master
            and slave name servers.  This is useful if you build new db  files
            on  a  host  other  than the master.  You must specify an absolute
            pathname.

       <B>-y</B> <I>[mode=D|M]</I>
            Set the SOA serial number of all created zones to use a  date/ver-
            sion  format.   The default format is YYYYMMDDvv where YYYY is the
            year, MM is the month, DD is the day of the month, and "vv" is the
            version  counter that starts at 00 and increments each time <B>h2n</B> is
            run on the same day.  The consistent appearance of this format  in
            the  SOA  record  implies  a limit of 100 updates per day.  The <B>-y</B>
            option may be specified with one of the following <I>mode=</I> flags:

            <I>D</I>  Set the daily format of YYYYMMDDvv (default).

            <I>M</I>  Set the monthly format of YYYYMMvvvv.  This allows up to 10,000
               updates per month to be made.

            NOTE: Serial number changes comply with the wrap-around arithmetic
                  specified by RFC-1982.  If setting the  <B>-y</B>  option  for  the
                  first  time,  it may take a subsequent run by <B>h2n</B> before the

       <B>-z</B> <I>ADDRESS</I> <I>...</I>
            Create a boot/conf file, <I>./[boot|conf].sec.save</I>, for a slave  name
            server  that  lists <I>ADDRESS</I> as the master to load from, and save a
            copy of the zone data in a backup file.  (This option  is  similar
            to the <B>-Z</B> option).  Including multiple <I>ADDRESS</I> arguments and/or <B>-z</B>
            options is allowed.

       <B>-Z</B> <I>ADDRESS</I> <I>...</I>
            Create a boot/conf  file,  <I>./[boot|conf].sec</I>,  for  a  slave  name
            server  that  lists <I>ADDRESS</I> as the master to load from, and do not
            save a copy of the data in a backup file.  (This option is similar
            to the <B>-z</B> option).  Including multiple <I>ADDRESS</I> arguments and/or <B>-Z</B>
            options is allowed.

       <B>[-no]-recurse</B>
            Controls whether or not delegated subdomains are themselves recur-
            sively verified after completing verification of the parent domain
            with the <B>-V</B> option.  Default is <B>-no-recurse</B>.

       <B>[-no]-check-del</B>
            Controls delegation checking when verifying one  or  more  domains
            with  the  <B>-V</B>  option.  NS records that delegate child domains are
            also checked.  Default is <B>-check-del</B>.

       <B>[-no]-show-nxdomain-cnames</B>
            Controls the display of  non-existent  external  domain  names  to
            which an internal CNAME points, i.e., "dangling" CNAMEs, if audit-
            ing is  in  effect.   CNAMEs  pointing  to  non-existent  internal
            domains are always reported.  Default is <B>-show-nxdomain-cnames</B>.

       <B>[-no]-show-chained-cnames</B>
            Controls the display of each element of an external CNAME chain to
            which an internal CNAME points.  The default behavior [<B>-no</B>] is  to
            ignore CNAME chains that successfully resolve and display just the
            chain length of dangling or looping CNAMEs.

       <B>[-no]-debug</B><I>[:DIRECTORY]</I>
            Controls the removal of all temporary files that get created  dur-
            ing the course of normal processing including a zone transfer file
            obtained with the <B>-V</B> option. If a domain is being  reverified  and
            the  zone  transfer  file  still  exists  from a previous run with
            <B>-debug</B>, then respecifying the <B>-debug</B> option will cause the  exist-
            ing zone transfer data to be used instead of requesting a new copy
            of the zone from an authoritative name  server.   Temporary  files
            are  created  in  the  <I>/tmp</I>  directory  unless  overridden  by the
            optional <I>DIRECTORY</I> argument.  Default is <B>-no-debug</B>.

</PRE>
<A NAME="DIAGNOSTICS"></A>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2><PRE>
       Error messages that occur when <B>h2n</B> processes its options list are self-
       explanatory and usually result in abnormal program termination.   Warn-
       ing  messages  related  to the processing of data in the host table and
       "spcl" files attempt to achieve concise clarity but do assume that  the
       user has basic knowledge of the DNS-related RFCs.

       When  a DNS zone is audited, various validity checks are done depending
       on the type of record being inspected (NS, MX,  etc.).   <B>h2n</B>  looks  up
       intra-zone  data  in  its  internal tables and calls the DiG program to
       make DNS queries for resolving references to extra-zone  domain  names.
       The following status codes are used to report badly configured data and
       DNS query failures:

       [CNAME chain ]  The domain name is an extra-zone CNAME that  points  to
                       another CNAME.  The total chain length appearing within
                       parentheses immediately follows.

       [ CNAME loop ]  The domain name is an extra-zone CNAME which ultimately
                       points  back  to itself.  If a CNAME chain is involved,
                       the total length appearing within  parentheses  immedi-
                       ately follows.

       [CNAME record]  The domain name refers to a CNAME record when it should
                       properly point to another record type, most  likely  an
                       address  record  (A,  AAAA,  or  A6).   In  addition to
                       address records, PTR records can point to NSAP  records
                       (RFC-1706) while RT records can also reference ISDN and
                       X25 records (RFC-1183).

       [(*) CNAME RR]  Same as above except that the  domain  name  matches  a
                       wildcard CNAME record.

       [ (*) MX RR  ]  Same  as  above  except  that the domain name matches a
                       wildcard MX record.

       [no addr. RR ]  The domain name  exists  and  should  have  an  address
                       record  (A,  AAAA,  or  A6) but no such RR type exists.
                       Also implies that no NSAP record exists if auditing PTR
                       records  and  no ISDN nor X25 records exist if auditing
                       RT records.

       [(*) non-A RR]  Same as above except that the  domain  name  matches  a
                       wildcard record that is not type A, AAAA, or A6.

       [ no TXT RR  ]  The domain name exists and should have a TXT record but
                       no such record type exists.

       [(*)nonTXT RR]  Same as above except that the  domain  name  matches  a
                       wildcard record that is not type TXT.

       [no A record ]  The  extra-zone  domain  name exists and should have an
                       address record but a DNS query returned no A RRs.

       [no such name]  The intra-zone domain name does not exist.

       [no RRs exist]  The domain name exists as a node in the DNS name  space
                       but  no  DNS  resource  records are associated with the
                       name.

       [  NXDOMAIN  ]  The requested extra-zone domain name does not exist.

       [  FORMERR   ]  The name server was unable to interpret the  DNS  query
                       due to a format error.

       [  SERVFAIL  ]  The  name  server encountered an internal failure while
                       processing the query, for example an  operating  system
                       error, a forwarding timeout, or a failure to load a DNS
                       zone due to bad data.

       [   NOTIMP   ]  The name server did not support the specified query.

       [  REFUSED   ]  The name server refused to perform the specified  query
                       for policy or security reasons.

       [ timed out  ]  The DNS query made by the DiG program timed out.

       [con. refused]  A  query was directed to a host which was not running a
                       name server process.

       [  no route  ]  A query was directed to an unreachable host.

       [unreachable ]  A query was directed to a host on an  unreachable  net-
                       work.

       [bad DNS msg.]  DiG received a malformed response to its DNS query.

       [buffer error]  An  overrun occurred in DiG's command buffer.  This can
                       be alleviated by running DiG 8.3 or newer.

       [sync. error ]  DiG generated unexpected output that  was  detected  by
                       <B>h2n</B>'s internal parser.

       <B>h2n</B> requires Perl 5 in order to run.   The  <B>-P</B>  option  for  preserving
       upper-case  characters in the host file requires the "Tie::CPHash" Perl
       module to be installed.  This module can be obtained from  the  Compre-
       hensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) site at:

           http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Tie::CPHash

       The  DiG  program is required for certain options (<B>-V</B>, <B>-I</B> <I>audit</I>) and to
       obtain the version of BIND that is running on the  master  name  server
       (<B>-h</B>  option)  in  order to optimize its functionality.  The source code
       for DiG is available in the standard BIND distribution at:

           http://www.isc.org/products/BIND

       The "check_del" utility.  You have a couple of choices:

       1.  Use the version written in Perl that's included with the  <B>h2n</B>  dis-
           tribution.   You'll  need the Net::DNS module which can be obtained
           from one of the following sites:

               http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Net::DNS
               http://www.net-dns.org/


       2.  A version written in <I>C</I> can be found  in  the  BIND  8  distribution
           under  the <I>contrib/nutshell</I> directory.  You'll have to compile BIND
           first since "check_del" needs to be  linked  with  some  of  BIND's
           static libraries.

       "check_del"  is  only  needed when <B>h2n</B> is used to verify a DNS zone via
       the <B>-V</B> option.
