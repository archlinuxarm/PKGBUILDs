[function]      Issue a warning and ignore the duplicate processing of
                a -f option if the specified file has already been read
                as an h2n[rc|.conf] file.

[bug]           Syntax errors when parsing options placed in an
                h2n[rc|.conf] file could cause an infinite loop.

[bug]           READ_RRs() did not properly handle the interchangability
                of the TTL and CLASS fields in resource records.

[bug]           TSIG meta-RRs appearing in the data stream of a signed
		AXFR query were not being recognized in READ_RRs().

        --- 2.55 released ---

[bug]           The default zone declaration for "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa"
		was not being omitted when a  -n 127.0.0/24  option was
                specified.

        --- 2.54 released ---

[bug]           Options requiring quoted whitespace, e.g., -T RR=" ...",
		were not being properly processed when encountered in
                an h2n configuration file.

        --- 2.53 released ---

[bug]           The -T option was effectively ignoring an `RR=' argument
		that did not contain any of the characters ["()] which
                might indicate a multi-line resource record.

        --- 2.52 released ---

[feature]       Added the +S option to allow supernetworks between different
                network class sizes.  Super/subnetworks may be specified with
                any combination of -a/-n options.  Added `mode=S' argument to
                the -a/-n option to permit selective supernetting.

[support]       SOA serial number manipulation by the -i and -y options is
                now compliant with RFC-1982.  Added `mode=D|M' argument to
                the -y option to allow choosing between YYYYMMDDvv and
                YYYYMMvvvv as the SOA date/version format.

[support]       Added DS to the list of recognized record types (see the
                document "draft-ietf-dnsext-delegation-signer-14.txt" at
                < http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/ >.

[support]       Added the BIND and LIBRESOLV vulnerabilities documented at
                < http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-31.html > to the
                tests done by GET_BIND_VERSION().

[bug]           Zone apex records submitted via the -T option (intended only
                for the forward-mapping zone file) were also being written
                to the reverse-mapping zone files.

[bug]           The PRINTF() subroutine was not checking Perl's printf()
                function to see if it successfully wrote to the zone file.

        --- 2.51 released ---

[function]      Print the appropriate $ORIGIN directive when displaying
                problematic resource records in zone-relative format.

[bug]           Test for missing glue didn't include situations where a
                name server for a parent zone is in a delegated child zone.

[bug]           The `mode=M' argument of the -T option did not generate
                MX records for the zone apex unless the `RR=' and/or
                `ALIAS=' arguments were also specified.

        --- 2.50 released ---

[bug]           Test for missing glue wasn't being confined to the NS
                record's RDATA being in the same zone as the owner.

        --- 2.49 released ---

[bug]           RRtypes that generated a "CNAME and other data" error
                weren't getting registered in the %RRowners hash.

        --- 2.48 released ---

[function]      If there is no matching -a/-n network for a host file entry
                that was just processed with the -c mode=I option, report
                the fact that a dangling CNAME may have been created as a
                side effect.

[function]      Specifying the -P option to preserve case without having the
                required Tie::CPHash CPAN module installed is now handled more
                gracefully.

[bug]           Fixed the wildcard matching algorithm in MATCH_DOMAIN() to
                comply with RFC-1034.  Wildcard matches are now cancelled
                by a subzone match or an existing RR owner name between
                the QNAME and the nearest wildcard.  Made a related fix to
                AUDIT_RRs() so that wildcard A/AAAA/A6 records are no longer
                considered as possible glue.

        --- 2.47 released ---

[feature]       Extended the -N/-a/-n options to support /8 to /15 networks
                as well as those sized /16 to /32.  A `-n NET/8' option writes
                a class-A reverse-mapping zone file while `-n NET/9' through
                `-n NET/16' writes to the equivalent number of class-B sized
                zone files.  Improved methods for detecting network overlaps.

[bug]           Fixed minor cosmetic spacing inconsistencies in the BIND 8/9
                conf. files generated by GEN_BOOT().

        --- 2.46 released ---

[bug]           Security vulnerability messages for BIND 9 versions were being
                output incorrectly.  Added checks for OpenSSL vulnerability of
                BIND 9.1.X.

        --- 2.45 released ---

[feature]       Included check for non-glue at or below zone cuts.

[feature]       Included check for NS RRs at zone top in verify mode.

[feature]       AFSDB/RT records are now checked for compliance with RFC-1183
                as are NSAP records with RFC-1706.  SRV records are checked to
                see if the RDATA Target field exists as a domain name with
                address records.  SRV owner names can be checked for compliance
                with RFC-2782 via the -I rfc2782 option (off by default).

[feature]       Displays warning if the detected BIND version is vulnerable
                per < http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/bind-security.html >.

[feature]       Displays warning and sets the exit code to 1 if detected
                errors are sufficiently severe to prevent a zone from
                being loaded.

[feature]       h2n will look for a configuration file for site-specific
                network information and pathnames to required external
                programs (DiG and check_del) as an alternative to having
                to edit the appropriate variables in the source code itself.
                The config file may also include command-line options as
                a way to customize h2n's defaults.

[feature]       Netmasks in -N/-n/-a options are now checked for contiguous
                bits.  CIDR sizes may also be used.  -n/-a network:netmask
                and network/CIDR specifications are checked for validity.

[feature]       Added support for sub-class-C networks (/25 to /32) that
                have been delegated via RFC-2317 or by individual IP address.
                The domain name holding the reverse-mapping zone data may be
                specified as well as a template for creating PTR owner names.

[feature]       -debug option is now -debug[:dir] to allow the
                specification of an alternate directory to /tmp.

[feature]       Added 'audit-only' to the -I option for disabling checks for
                illegal characters in domain names when auditing/verifying
                zone data for consistency.

[feature]       Added 'mode=I' to the -c option to allow the creation of
                CNAMEs that point to intra-zone multi-label host names.
                Added '[no -c]' host file flag to allow for exceptions.

[feature]       Added 'mode=M' to the +c option to enable zone statements in
                BIND 8/9 conf files to be written in multi-line, indented
                format instead of mimicking the one-line format of a BIND 4
                boot file.

[feature]       Added +C option to prepend an include file of BIND 8/9
                configuration statements, e.g., ACLs, to the h2n-generated
                config. file specified by the +c option.

[feature]       Added '-P' option to preserve upper-case characters of
                hostnames and aliases in the host table.  If '-P' is
                specified, the CPAN module 'Tie::CPHash' is required to
                be present.

[feature]       Added '-T' option for including top-of-zone-related RRs
                such as the global MX RRset from the -m option instead
                of having to create a 'spcl' file.

[feature]       Added '[no-]-show-nxdomain-cnames' option to control the
                reporting of dangling CNAMEs.

[feature]       Added '-?' option for displaying usage information.

[feature]       Added '[no ptr]' host file flag to skip the generation of
                the PTR record for a particular entry.  Useful in situations
                where multiple A records must point to the same IP address
                instead of using CNAMEs to point to the same canonical name.

[feature]       FIXUP() will remove redundantly-specified name servers (-s/S).
                Redundant MX hosts (-m) are also detected and only the one
                with the highest priority (smallest preference value) is kept.

[feature]       Time intervals expressed in seconds will be converted to
                symbolic format, e.g., 604800 -> 1W, if supported by the
                BIND version running on the master name server (-h option).

[support]       The -v option now prints h2n's version string for
                compatibility with BIND's programs.  The verify option
                is now -V.

[support]       Generation of $TTL directives is now assumed when unable
                to determine which BIND version is running on the master
                name server unless a special -o option is also specified.  

[support]       h2n will now quit instead of overwriting a detected
                dynamic zone file.

[support]       Wildcard NS owner names are now flagged as errors
                since BIND 9 refuses to load zones containing them.
                They were never valid anyway.

[support]       All host/domain names are now passed to CHECK_NAME() which
                always does a basic sanity check (no leading, trailing,
                or consecutive unescaped dots) even if RFC1123-type
                checking is disabled.

[support]       The READ_RRs() lexer now mimics the stricter syntax checking
                that BIND 9 performs when reading text from a zone file and
                assembling the RFC-1035 DNS records.

[support]       Intra-zone address/glue/non-glue searches now include AAAA and
                A6 RRs.  KEY RRs at a zone cut won't be flagged as non-glue.

[support]       Checks to prevent "CNAME and other data" errors now accommodate
                the DNSSEC RRtypes SIG, NXT, and KEY as exceptions.

[support]       Accommodate format changes made in DiG versions 9.1.X and later
                regarding the way SOA records and AXFR statistics are displayed.

[support]       $GENERATE simulator now recognizes DNAME as a supported RRtype.
                "$$" in a template is now accepted as a literal "$".

[support]       Improved flexibility in the handling of various host table
                formatting/maintenance styles.

[function]      Specifying multiple -N options is allowed and will no
                longer generate a warning.

[function]      Specifying "[smtp]" in comment section of a host file entry
                is now sufficient by itself to prevent the generation of
                global MX records (-m option) for a host and leave just a
                single self-pointing MX record.  The "[smtp] [no mx]" flag
                combination is no longer necessary.

[performance]   Two arrays related to -n/-a processing were being serially
                searched in N-squared time.  Replaced by a single hash lookup
                that enables the host table to be processed 2X-3X faster.

[performance]   Increased time/space efficiency in AUDIT_RRs() by eliminating
                a couple of redundant hashes.  Also, hashes and lists are
                undefined when no longer needed in order to recycle space for
                other data structures.  Hash keys and values are stored in
                zone-relative format whenever practical.

[cleanup]       Code blocks for dealing with the various options now
                appear alphabetically in PARSE_ARGS().  More attention is
                paid to strict bounds checking and to a consistent manner
                of parsing options and arguments.

[bug]           The +om and +os options were being ignored for the
                forward-mapping zone (-d option).

[bug]           The validation of 'spcl.network' files for reverse-mapping
                domains was being skipped under certain circumstances.

[bug]           Array of locally-connected subnets was being incorrectly
                initialized.

[bug]           Fixed broken code for working around limits on concurrent
                open files.  Open DB files are now explicitly closed before
                calling AUDIT_RRs().

[bug]           Consolidated repetitive code into MATCH_DOMAIN() and fixed
                a case where multi-label wildcards failed to match child
                domain membership.

[bug]           NS records below a zone cut were being treated as a
                legitimate delegation.

[bug]           Fixed various Perl warnings about uninitialized variables
                in GEN_NAME().  $GENERATE templates with negative offsets
                weren't being recognized.

[bug]           Fixed the pattern-matching parser in READ_RRs() to recognize
                resource records with "$" in the owner field.

[bug]           Relative domain names and the "@" symbol weren't being 
                properly handled by READ_RRs() when parsing $ORIGIN and
                $INCLUDE directives.  Current owner name wasn't being
                passed when processing an $INCLUDE file.

[bug]           Some RRs weren't getting registered in %RRowners when
                being written to a zone file.

[bug]           Fixed AUDIT_RRs() so that hash indices are no longer deleted
                in the same loop that is simultaneously reading the hash.

[bug]           Fixed AUDIT_RRs() so that an explicit domain name match not
                having the expected RRtype will not fall through and be
                mistakenly matched by a wildcard.

[bug]           RDATA fields that point to an existing intra-zone DNS node
                with no associated resource records will be audited with
                a "no RRs exist" status instead of "no such name".

[bug]           Some variables in CHECK_SOA_TIMERS() weren't being initialized.

[bug]           Zone files that are built without a $TTL directive are now
                created with an explicit TTL field in the first (SOA) record
                as required by RFC-1035.

[bug]           MAKE_SOA() was unable to read the various formats in which
                a valid SOA record could appear.

[bug]           Added trailing dot to zone being verified since 'dig ns ns'
                doesn't respond as expected but 'dig ns. ns' does.

[bug]           Fixed various looping problems when verifying a root zone.

[bug]           -c option processing block was not being exited in a timely
                manner after dealing with a matching domain.  "CNAME and
                other data" conflicts weren't being reported.  Conflicts
                when processing deferred CNAMEs might report wrong data.

[bug]           -c/-p options now sort domains within a subtree so that
                subdomains are matched before parent domains.  Parent
                domains of the -d option can also appear in -c/-p options
                since host names matching the -d domain are bypassed.

[bug]           The -e option now sorts domains within a subtree so that
                only the top-most domain is retained.  Subdomains that
                match a -d/-c/-p option are bypassed.

[bug]           Wasn't checking IPv4 addresses for octets > 255 or with
                leading zeros.

[bug]           As of BIND 4.9.4, RNAME fields in SOA and RP records can have
                any printable character in the first label as long as the
                subsequent labels represent a valid hostname.  This means that
                an RNAME of  viewer\@fx.movie.edu  is valid.  Made the fixes
                to READ_RRs() for accommodating this [belated] discovery.
                However, the -u option in FIXUP() will still prefer to change
                "@" to "." per RFC-1035 (accept liberally but generate
                conservatively).

[bug]           Don't subject the owner names of NS RRs to RFC-1123 name
                checking.  The RDATA fields of NS, MX, SRV, PTR, AFSDB, and
                RT records are subject to RFC-1123 as are SOA MNAMEs plus the
                domain name portion of SOA and RP RNAMEs.

[bug]           Verifying zones with "/<|>&$^[+?\;@'`()" characters appearing
                in the domain name was causing havoc when dealing with the
                shell, creating temporary filenames, and pattern-matching
                FQDNs.  Now accommodated by escapes and character substitution.
