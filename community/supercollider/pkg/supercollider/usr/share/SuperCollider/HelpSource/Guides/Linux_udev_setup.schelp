title:: Linux Udev Setup
summary:: Suggestion on udev setup
categories:: Platform>Linux

In the file code:: /etc/udev/udev.rules ::

(on Debian /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules)

(on Ubuntu this should be in /etc/udev/rules.d/20-names.rules)

make sure there is the following:
code::
KERNEL=="event[0-9]*",          NAME="input/%k",        GROUP="audio"
::
i.e. add code:: GROUP="audio" :: to the lines, so that any user in the group "audio" can open the device.

For a quick fix (at your own risk, any user can then get read/write access to your input devices) you can also do from the terminal:

code::
$ cd /dev/input
$ sudo chmod 777 event*
