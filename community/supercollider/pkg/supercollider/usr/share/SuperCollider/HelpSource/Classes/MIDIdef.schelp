DESCRIPTION::
MIDIdef provides a global reference to the functionality of its superclass link::Classes/MIDIFunc::. Essentially it stores itself at a key within a global dictionary, allowing replacement at any time. Most methods are inherited from its superclass.

note:: MIDIdef and link::Classes/MIDIFunc:: aim to improve upon the MIDIresponder classes by being faster and easier to use. They were made with the intention of creating a more convenient, logical and consistent interface, which shares a common design with link::Classes/OSCFunc:: and link::Classes/OSCdef::. As of this time, however, they still lack some features of the MIDIresponder classes, notably the learn method. Note that unlike those classes, MIDIdefs are removed on Cmd-. by default. This can be overriden using either of the fix or permanent methods.::


CLASSMETHODS::
private:: initClass

METHOD:: all
Get the global dictionary of all MIDIdefs.

returns:: An link::Classes/IdentityDictionary::.

METHOD:: new
Create a new, enabled MIDIdef. If a MIDIdef already exists at this key, its parameters will be replaced with the ones provided (args for which nil is passed will use the old values). Normally one would use one of the message type specific convenience methods below, rather than use this method directly.

argument:: key
The key at which to store this OSCdef in the global collection. Generally this will be a link::Classes/Symbol::.

argument:: func
A link::Classes/Function:: or similar object which will respond to the incoming message. When evaluated for noteOn, noteOff, control, and polytouch messages it will be passed the arguments val, num, chan, and src, corresponding to the message value (e.g. velocity, control value, etc.), message number (e.g. note number), MIDI channel, and MIDI source uid. For touch, programme change and bend messages it will be passed only val, chan, and src.

argument:: msgNum
An link::Classes/Integer:: indicating the MIDI message number (note number, control number, or programme number) for this MIDIdef. This can be an array. If nil, the MIDIdef will respond to messages of all possible message numbers.

argument:: chan
An link::Classes/Integer:: indicating the MIDI channel number for this MIDIdef. This can be an array. If nil, the MIDIdef will respond to messages received on all channels.

argument:: msgType
A link::Classes/Symbol:: indicating which kind of MIDI message this MIDIdef should respond to. One of code::\noteOn::, code::\noteOff::, code::\control::, code::\touch::, code::\polytouch::, code::\bend::, or code::program::.

argument:: srcID
An link::Classes/Integer:: corresponding to the uid of the MIDI input. (See link::Classes/MIDIClient::.) If nil, the MIDIdef will respond to messages received from all sources.

argument:: argTemplate
An optional link::Classes/Integer:: or link::Classes/Function:: (or object which responds to the method link::Overviews/Methods#matchItem::) used to match the value of an incoming MIDI message. (e.g. velocity, control value, program number, etc.). If a Function, it will be evaluated with the message value as an argument, and should return a link::Classes/Boolean:: indicating whether the message matches and this MIDIdef should respond.

argument:: dispatcher
An optional instance of an appropriate subclass of link::Classes/AbstractDispatcher::. This can be used to allow for customised dispatching. Normally this should not be needed.

returns:: An instance of MIDIdef.

METHOD:: cc
A convenience method to create a new MIDIdef which responds to MIDI control messages. See link::#*new:: for argument descriptions.

returns:: An instance of MIDIdef which responds to MIDI control messages.

METHOD:: noteOn
A convenience method to create a new MIDIdef which responds to MIDI note on messages. See link::#*new:: for argument descriptions.

returns:: An instance of MIDIdef which responds to MIDI note on messages.

METHOD:: noteOff
A convenience method to create a new MIDIdef which responds to MIDI note off messages. See link::#*new:: for argument descriptions.

returns:: An instance of MIDIdef which responds to MIDI note off messages.

METHOD:: polytouch
A convenience method to create a new MIDIdef which responds to MIDI polytouch messages. See link::#*new:: for argument descriptions.

returns:: An instance of MIDIdef which responds to MIDI polytouch messages.

METHOD:: touch
A convenience method to create a new MIDIdef which responds to MIDI touch messages. See link::#*new:: for argument descriptions.

returns:: An instance of MIDIdef which responds to MIDI touch messages.

METHOD:: bend
A convenience method to create a new MIDIdef which responds to MIDI bend messages. See link::#*new:: for argument descriptions.

returns:: An instance of MIDIdef which responds to MIDI bend messages.

METHOD:: program
A convenience method to create a new MIDIdef which responds to MIDI program change messages. See link::#*new:: for argument descriptions.

returns:: An instance of MIDIdef which responds to MIDI program change messages.

METHOD:: freeAll
Clears and deactivates all MIDIdefs from the global collection.

INSTANCEMETHODS::
private:: addToAll, printOn

METHOD:: key
Get this MIDIdef's key.

returns:: Usually a link::Classes/Symbol::.

METHOD:: free
Clears this MIDIdef from the global collection and deactivates it.


EXAMPLES::

code::
MIDIIn.connectAll
MIDIdef.cc(\test1, {arg ...args; args.postln}, 1); // match cc 1
MIDIdef.cc(\test2, {arg ...args; args.postln}, 1, 1); // match cc1, chan 1
MIDIdef.cc(\test3, {arg ...args; args.postln}, (1..10)); // match cc 1-10
MIDIdef.noteOn(\test4, {arg ...args; args.postln}); // match any noteOn

MIDIIn.doNoteOnAction(1, 1, 64, 64); // spoof a note on
MIDIIn.doControlAction(1, 1, 1, 64); // spoof a cc
MIDIIn.doControlAction(1, 1, 9, 64);
MIDIIn.doControlAction(1, 10, 1, 64);

MIDIdef(\test1).free; // free one def
MIDIdef.freeAll;      // free all registered MIDIdefs
