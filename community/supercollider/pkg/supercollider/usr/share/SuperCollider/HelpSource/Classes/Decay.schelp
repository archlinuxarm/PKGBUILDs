class:: Decay
summary:: Exponential decay
related:: Classes/Decay2
categories:: UGens>Filters>Linear, UGens>Envelopes

Description::

This is essentially the same as  link::Classes/Integrator::  except that
instead of supplying the coefficient directly, it is calculated from a 60
dB decay time. This is the time required for the integrator to lose 99.9%
of its value or -60dB. This is useful for exponential decaying envelopes
triggered by impulses.

classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::in
The input signal.

argument::decayTime
60 dB decay time in seconds.

argument::mul

argument::add

Examples::

code::
plot({ Decay.ar(Impulse.ar(1), 0.01) });

// used as an envelope
play({ Decay.ar(Impulse.ar(XLine.kr(1,50,20), 0.25), 0.2, PinkNoise.ar, 0) });
