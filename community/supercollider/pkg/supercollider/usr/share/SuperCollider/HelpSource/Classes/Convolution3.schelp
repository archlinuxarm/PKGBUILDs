categories::  UGens>FFT, UGens>Convolution

Description::
Strict convolution with fixed kernel which can be updated using a trigger signal. The convolution is performed in the time domain, which is highly inefficient, and probably only useful for either very short kernel sizes, or for control rate signals.

See link::Classes/Convolution2:: and link::Classes/Convolution2L:: for more efficient convolution UGens.
