summary:: A uniform class to an HID device
related:: Classes/HIDDeviceService, Classes/LID, Classes/GeneralHID, Classes/GeneralHIDSpec
categories:: External Control>HID

description::
GeneralHID is a cross platform wrapper for accessing HID devices. Currently the MacOSX and Linux HID support has been wrapped. Some of the code is inspired by the GUI wrapper.
A GeneralHIDDevice accesses one HID device, such as a mouse, joystick or gamepad. Devices are automatically created when a building the device list with link::Classes/GeneralHID::, so it is not necessary for a user to create a new device.

See link::Classes/GeneralHID:: for a complete explanation and an example of how to access an HID device.

note::
It is advised to use this class instead of the platform specific classes: link::Classes/HIDDeviceService:: (on MacOSX) and link::Classes/LID:: (on Linux)

subsection::Some outstanding issues
This class is not completely finished yet. Common slot numbers across platforms are not yet guaranteed. On Windows there is not yet a proper implementation available.

InstanceMethods::

method::isOpen
Checks whether the device is open.

method::info
Display information about the device, such as the name and vendor.

method::caps
Display information about the capabilities of the device in a readable format.

method::slots

method::makeGui
Make a generic gui to see the data coming in on the slots.
