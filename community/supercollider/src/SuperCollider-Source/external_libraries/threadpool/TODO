threadpool to-do items
======================

Documentation
--------------------------------------------
- Source code documentation
- Design rationale
- Tutorial
- Finish Quickstart Tutorial/Example

Functionality
--------------------------------------------
- Implement a size policy which dynamically 
  increase/decrease the pool's size:
  - init with min/max threads
  - auto increase
  - auto decrease (using timed cleanup tasks)
- Add some kind of deadline scheduler
- Add futures to pool


Examples
--------------------------------------------
- Buffering Client Requests: Handle 'bursty' client traffic
  Some applications need more buffering than is provided by OS I/O subsystem
  
  Working on 'active' buffer for boost::iostreams
  buffer_filter which provides a dynamic amount of buffer objects. 
  buffer_filter uses a threadpool with one thread which provides the buffers to 
  consumer. (TODO Philipp)
  
  2nd implemention step:
  Flexbile configuration: Buffer capacities can be configured according to
    - maximum number of requests
    - maximum number of bytes
