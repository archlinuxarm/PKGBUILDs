This package is very compiling-intensive, there are a few things to note:
1. It took ~30 minutes to compile, distributed across 2 Dockstars.
2. It will eat through all physical RAM on a Dockstar, you must have swap space to compile.
3. I wouldn't bother cross-compiling on qemu unless you have proven your setup to be faster than the plugs.
