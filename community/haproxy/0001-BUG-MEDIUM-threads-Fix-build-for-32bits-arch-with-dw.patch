Subject: [PATCH] BUG/MEDIUM: threads: Fix build for 32bits arch with dwcas.

_HA_ATOMIC_DWCAS() only exists in 2.0, not in 1.9, so use HA_ATOMIC_DWCAS.
This should fix build on 32bits arches that have a double-word CAS
implemented (currently only armv7).
This is a direct commit to 1.9, as the problem doesn't exist in 2.0, and
it shouldn't be backported to 1.8.
