[This is an edited version of the original mg README, updated slightly to
reflect changes in the last 20 years.]


Mg (mg) is a Public Domain EMACS style editor.  It is "broadly"
compatible with GNU Emacs, the latest creation of Richard M.
Stallman, Chief GNUisance and inventor of Emacs.  GNU Emacs (and other
portions of GNU as they are released) are essentially free, (there are
handling charges for obtaining it) and so is Mg.  You may never have
to learn another editor.  (But probably will, at least long enough to
port Mg...)  Mg was formerly named MicroGnuEmacs, the name change was
done at the request of Richard Stallman.

Mg is not associated with the GNU project, and most of it does not
have the copyright restrictions present in GNU Emacs.  (However, some
of the system dependent modules and the regular expression module do
have copyright notices.  Look at the source code for exact
copyright restrictions.)  The Mg authors individually may or may not
agree with the opinions expressed by Richard Stallman in "The GNU
Manifesto".

This program is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for
people who can't (or don't want to) run real Emacs for one reason
or another.  It is compatible with GNU because there shouldn't be
any reason to learn more than one Emacs flavor.

Known limitations:

Recursive bindings may cause help and key rebinding code to go into
an infinite loop, aborting with a stack overflow.

Overwrite mode does not work in macros.	 (Characters are inserted
rather than overwriting.)

Dired mode has some problems:  Rename does not update the buffer.
Doing a dired again will update the buffer (whether it needs it or
not) and will lose any marks for deletion.  .. and . are not
recognized as special cases.

On systems with 16 bit integers, the kill buffer cannot exceed 32767
bytes.



New implementation oddities:

insert and define-key are new commands corresponding to the mocklisp
functions in Gnu Emacs.	 (Mg does not have non-command functions.)
(Mg's insert will only insert one string.)

The display wrap code does not work at all like that of GNU emacs.
