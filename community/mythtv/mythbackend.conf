# Config variables for the mythbackend startup script, which is usually
# located in /etc/rc.d/mythbackend
#
# When the startup script is executed, it sources this file if it exists,
# otherwise it will fall back on default values.
#
# Leave variables commented out to use default values in init script
# (/etc/rc.d/mythbackend).
#
# To override defaults, uncomment the relevant variable definition and
# edit as required.
#

#
# User who should start the mythbackend processes
#
# Running mythbackend as non-root requires you to ensure that audio/video
# devices used for recording have suitable user permissions. One way
# to achieve this is to modify existing or create new udev rules which
# assign these devices to a non-root group with rw permissions and add
# your mythbackend user to that group. Be aware that console.perms can 
# also affect device permissions and may need additional configuration.
# Running as non-root may also introduce increased process latency.
#
