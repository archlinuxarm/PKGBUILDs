     Sure.  The canonical versions are available on ftp.armory.com; you might
want to pick up the latest versions before modifying them.

} Hi.  I'm the maintainer of bash (the GNU `Bourne Again shell') for
} the FSF.
} 
} I picked up a tar file of ksh scripts you wrote from an anon FTP site
} a while back.  I'd like your permission to include modified versions
} of some of them in the next major bash distribution (with proper credit
} given, of course).  Is it OK if I do that?
