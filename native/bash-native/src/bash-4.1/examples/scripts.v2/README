This collection of scripts was originally written for ksh-88 by
John DuBois <spcecdt@armory.com>.  The conversion to bash v2
syntax was done by Chet Ramey.

These scripts are as-is; there is no copyright associated with
any of them.  They exist simply as examples of bash scripting.

Here's a description of what's in this directory:
