This collection of scripts was originally written for older versions
of bash by Noah Friedman (friedman@gnu.ai.mit.edu).  The conversion
to bash v2 syntax was done by Chet Ramey.

These scripts are as-is; there is no copyright associated with
any of them.  They exist simply as examples of bash scripting.

Here's a description of what's in this directory:

aref.bash		Pseudo-arrays and substring indexing examples.
bash.sub.bash		Library functions used by require.bash.
