# whatis -- and implementation of the 10th Edition Unix sh builtin `whatis'
#	    command.
#
# usage: whatis arg [...]
#
# For each argument, whatis prints the associated value as a parameter,
# builtin, function, alias, or executable file as appropriate.  In each
# case, the value is printed in a form which would yield the same value
# if typed as input to the shell itself.
