    I've modified a (modified) version of Bill Rosenblatt's ksh debugger
    to work with bash-2.0.  Does ORA have any problem with me distributing
    it with bash-2.0?
    
That's great!

Go ahead and circulate it; in fact, we should probably grab it and
stick it in our ftp archive, and put a reference to it in the book.
(Too late to actually discuss the thing, at least for this edition).
