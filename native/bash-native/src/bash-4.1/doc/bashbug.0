       bbaasshhbbuugg is a shell script to help the user compose and mail bug reports
       concerning bash in a standard format.  bbaasshhbbuugg invokes the editor spec-
       ified by the environment variable EEDDIITTOORR on a temporary copy of the bug
       report format outline. The user must fill in the appropriate fields and
       exit  the  editor.   bbaasshhbbuugg  then  mails  the completed report to _b_u_g_-
       _b_a_s_h_@_g_n_u_._o_r_g, or _e_m_a_i_l_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s.  If the report cannot be mailed, it  is
       saved in the file _d_e_a_d_._b_a_s_h_b_u_g in the invoking user's home directory.

       The  bug report format outline consists of several sections.  The first
       section provides information about the machine, operating  system,  the
       bash  version,  and  the  compilation  environment.  The second section
       should be filled in with a description of the bug.  The  third  section
       should  be  a  description  of  how to reproduce the bug.  The optional
       fourth section is for a proposed fix.  Fixes are encouraged.

       bbaasshhbbuugg will utilize the following environment variables if they exist:

              defaults to eemmaaccss.

              fails.
