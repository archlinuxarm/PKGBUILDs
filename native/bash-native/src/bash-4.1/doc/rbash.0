       rbash - restricted bash, see bbaasshh(1)

RREESSTTRRIICCTTEEDD SSHHEELLLL
       If bbaasshh is started with the name rrbbaasshh, or the --rr option is supplied at
       invocation, the shell becomes restricted.  A restricted shell  is  used
       to  set  up an environment more controlled than the standard shell.  It
       behaves identically to bbaasshh with the exception that the  following  are
       disallowed or not performed:

       +o      changing directories with ccdd

       +o      setting or unsetting the values of SSHHEELLLL, PPAATTHH, EENNVV, or BBAASSHH__EENNVV

       +o      specifying command names containing //

       +o      specifying a file name containing a // as an argument  to  the  ..
              builtin command

       +o      Specifying  a  filename containing a slash as an argument to the
              --pp option to the hhaasshh builtin command

       +o      importing function definitions from  the  shell  environment  at
              startup

       +o      parsing  the  value  of  SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS from the shell environment at
              startup

       +o      redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >> redirect-
              ion operators

       +o      using the eexxeecc builtin command to replace the shell with another
              command

       +o      adding or deleting builtin commands with the --ff and  --dd  options
              to the eennaabbllee builtin command

       +o      Using  the  eennaabbllee  builtin  command  to  enable  disabled shell
              builtins

       +o      specifying the --pp option to the ccoommmmaanndd builtin command

       +o      turning off restricted mode with sseett ++rr or sseett ++oo rreessttrriicctteedd.

       These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.

       When a command that is found to be a shell script  is  executed,  rrbbaasshh
       turns  off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.
