$PRODUCES type.c

$BUILTIN type
$FUNCTION type_builtin
$SHORT_DOC type [-afptP] name [name ...]
Display information about command type.

For each NAME, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a
command name.

Options:
  -a	display all locations containing an executable named NAME;
	includes aliases, builtins, and functions, if and only if
	the `-p' option is not also used
  -f	suppress shell function lookup
  -P	force a PATH search for each NAME, even if it is an alias,
	builtin, or function, and returns the name of the disk file
	that would be executed
  -p	returns either the name of the disk file that would be executed,
	or nothing if `type -t NAME' would not return `file'.
  -t	output a single word which is one of `alias', `keyword',
	`function', `builtin', `file' or `', if NAME is an alias, shell
	reserved word, shell function, shell builtin, disk file, or not 
	found, respectively

Arguments:
  NAME	Command name to be interpreted.

Exit Status:
Returns success if all of the NAMEs are found; fails if any are not found.

	-a		Returns all occurrences of words, whether they

	-f		Suppress shell function lookup, like `command'.

	-P		Force a path search even in the presence of other
			definitions.

	alias

	function
