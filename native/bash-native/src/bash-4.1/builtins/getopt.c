   When `sh_getopt' returns EOF, this is the index of the first of the

/* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
   given in OPTSTRING.

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `sh_getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If `sh_getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating `sh_optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `sh_getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, `sh_getopt' returns `EOF'.
   Then `sh_optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `sh_opterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in `sh_optarg'. */
