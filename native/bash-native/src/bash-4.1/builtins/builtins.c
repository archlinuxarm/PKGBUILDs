/* The list of shell builtins.  Each element is name, function, flags,
   long-doc, short-doc.  The long-doc field contains a pointer to an array
   of help lines.  The function takes a WORD_LIST *; the first word in the
   list is the first arg to the command.  The list has already had word
   expansion performed.

   Functions which need to look at only the simple commands (e.g.
   the enable_builtin ()), should ignore entries where
   (array[i].function == (sh_builtin_func_t *)NULL).  Such entries are for
   the list of shell reserved control structures, like `if' and `while'.
   The end of the list is denoted with a NULL name field. */

    \n\
    OPTSTRING contains the option letters to be recognized; if a letter\n\
    is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument,\n\
    which should be separated from it by white space.\n\
    \n\
    Each time it is invoked, getopts will place the next option in the\n\
    shell variable $name, initializing name if it does not exist, and\n\
    the index of the next argument to be processed into the shell\n\
    variable OPTIND.  OPTIND is initialized to 1 each time the shell or\n\
    a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an argument,\n\
    getopts places that argument into the shell variable OPTARG.\n\
    \n\
    getopts reports errors in one of two ways.  If the first character\n\
    of OPTSTRING is a colon, getopts uses silent error reporting.  In\n\
    this mode, no error messages are printed.  If an invalid option is\n\
    seen, getopts places the option character found into OPTARG.  If a\n\
    required argument is not found, getopts places a ':' into NAME and\n\
    sets OPTARG to the option character found.  If getopts is not in\n\
    silent mode, and an invalid option is seen, getopts places '?' into\n\
    NAME and unsets OPTARG.  If a required argument is not found, a '?'\n\
    is placed in NAME, OPTARG is unset, and a diagnostic message is\n\
    printed.\n\
    \n\
    If the shell variable OPTERR has the value 0, getopts disables the\n\
    printing of error messages, even if the first character of\n\
    OPTSTRING is not a colon.  OPTERR has the value 1 by default.\n\
