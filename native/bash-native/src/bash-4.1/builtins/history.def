$BUILTIN history
$FUNCTION history_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON HISTORY
$SHORT_DOC history [-c] [-d offset] [n] or history -anrw [filename] or history -ps arg [arg...]
Display or manipulate the history list.

Display the history list with line numbers, prefixing each modified
entry with a `*'.  An argument of N lists only the last N entries.

Options:
  -c	clear the history list by deleting all of the entries
  -d offset	delete the history entry at offset OFFSET.

  -a	append history lines from this session to the history file
  -n	read all history lines not already read from the history file
  -r	read the history file and append the contents to the history
	list
  -w	write the current history to the history file
	and append them to the history list

  -p	perform history expansion on each ARG and display the result
	without storing it in the history list
  -s	append the ARGs to the history list as a single entry

If FILENAME is given, it is used as the history file.  Otherwise,
if $HISTFILE has a value, that is used, else ~/.bash_history.

If the $HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set and not null, its value is used
as a format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated
with each displayed history entry.  No time stamps are printed otherwise.

Exit Status:
Returns success unless an invalid option is given or an error occurs.
