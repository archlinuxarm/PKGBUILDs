$PRODUCES fg_bg.c

$BUILTIN fg
$FUNCTION fg_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON JOB_CONTROL
$SHORT_DOC fg [job_spec]
Move job to the foreground.

Place the job identified by JOB_SPEC in the foreground, making it the
current job.  If JOB_SPEC is not present, the shell's notion of the
current job is used.

Exit Status:
Status of command placed in foreground, or failure if an error occurs.

$BUILTIN bg
$FUNCTION bg_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON JOB_CONTROL
$SHORT_DOC bg [job_spec ...]
Move jobs to the background.

Place the jobs identified by each JOB_SPEC in the background, as if they
had been started with `&'.  If JOB_SPEC is not present, the shell's notion
of the current job is used.

Exit Status:
Returns success unless job control is not enabled or an error occurs.
