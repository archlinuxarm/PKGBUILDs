 * MEM is the address of the allocated pointer.
 * SIZE is the requested allocation size.
 * FLAGS includes either MT_ALLOC (MEM is allocated) or MT_FREE (MEM is
 * not allocated).  Other flags later.
 * FUNC is set to the name of the function doing the allocation (from the
 * `tag' argument to register_alloc().
 * FILE and LINE are the filename and line number of the last allocation
 * and free (depending on STATUS) of MEM.
 * NALLOC and NFREE are incremented on each allocation that returns MEM or
 * each free of MEM, respectively (way to keep track of memory reuse
 * and how well the free lists are working).

/*
 * void HASH_MIX
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.  For every delta with one or two
 * bits set, and the deltas of all three high bits or all three low
 * bits, whether the original value of a,b,c is almost all zero or is
 * uniformly distributed.
 *
 * If HASH_MIX() is run forward or backward, at least 32 bits in a,b,c
 * have at least 1/4 probability of changing.  If mix() is run
 * forward, every bit of c will change between 1/3 and 2/3 of the
 * time.  (Well, 22/100 and 78/100 for some 2-bit deltas.)
 *
 * HASH_MIX() takes 36 machine instructions, but only 18 cycles on a
 * superscalar machine (like a Pentium or a Sparc).  No faster mixer
 * seems to work, that's the result of my brute-force search.  There
 * were about 2^68 hashes to choose from.  I only tested about a
 * billion of those.
