/*
 * NMALLOC[i] is the difference between the number of mallocs and frees
 * for a given block size.  TMALLOC[i] is the total number of mallocs for
 * a given block size.  NMORECORE[i] is the total number of calls to
 * morecore(i).  NLESSCORE[i] is the total number of calls to lesscore(i).
 *
 * NMAL and NFRE are counts of the number of calls to malloc() and free(),
 * respectively.  NREALLOC is the total number of calls to realloc();
 * NRCOPY is the number of times realloc() had to allocate new memory and
 * copy to it.  NRECURSE is a count of the number of recursive calls to
 * malloc() for the same bucket size, which can be caused by calls to
 * malloc() from a signal handler.
 *
 * NSBRK is the number of calls to sbrk() (whether by morecore() or for
 * alignment); TSBRK is the total number of bytes requested from the kernel
 * with sbrk().
 *
 * BYTESUSED is the total number of bytes consumed by blocks currently in
 * use; BYTESFREE is the total number of bytes currently on all of the free
 * lists.  BYTESREQ is the total number of bytes requested by the caller
 * via calls to malloc() and realloc().
 *
 * TBSPLIT is the number of times a larger block was split to satisfy a
 * smaller request. NSPLIT[i] is the number of times a block of size I was
 * split.
 *
 * TBCOALESCE is the number of times two adjacent smaller blocks off the free
 * list were combined to satisfy a larger request.
