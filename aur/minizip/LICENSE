crypt.h

   Version 1.01e, February 12th, 2005

   Copyright (C) 1998-2005 Gilles Vollant

   This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution

   The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
   non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
   whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
   (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)

   This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
   Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
   file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
   version without encryption capabilities).
