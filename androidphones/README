This directory is to develop a way to boot Plugbox
on Android phones (HTC for now?).

==== On the Phone ====
- Any ROM, rooted
- A big SD card - Plugbox needs at least 300MB to work nicely
- Terminal Emulator from the Android Market
- "adb" from the Android SDK base package
- USB debugging mode enabled in Settings

==== Preparing an image ====

You'll need to make an ext2 image file (for now).
Download Plugbox as a .tar.gz file,
use dd if=/dev/zero of=plugbox.img count=10000000
then mkfs.ext2 plugbox.img (answer yes to force it),
mount -o loop plugbox.img ./plugboxmountfolder
then extract the rootfs into there, without a kernel or anything.
Unmount the image, put it in the ./plugbox folder found here,
and then copy that entire folder to /sdcard/ on your phone,
so it looks like /sdcard/plugbox/plugbox.img, etc.

More soon.
