/* We have to and actually can handle cancelable system().  The big
   problem: we have to kill the child process if necessary.  To do
   this a cleanup handler has to be registered and is has to be able
   to find the PID of the child.  The main problem is to reliable have
   the PID when needed.  It is not necessary for the parent thread to
   return.  It might still be in the kernel when the cancellation
   request comes.  Therefore we have to use the clone() calls ability
   to have the kernel write the PID into the user-level variable.  */
