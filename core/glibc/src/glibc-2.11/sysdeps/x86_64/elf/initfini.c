/* This file is compiled into assembly code which is then munged by a sed
   script into two files: crti.s and crtn.s.

   * crti.s puts a function prologue at the beginning of the
   .init and .fini sections and defines global symbols for
   those addresses, so they can be called as functions.

   * crtn.s puts the corresponding function epilogues
   in the .init and .fini sections. */
