  /* The __SHARED field is computed to minimize the work that needs to
     be done while handling the futex.  There are two inputs: the
     availability of private futexes and whether the rwlock is shared
     or private.  Unfortunately the value of a private rwlock is
     fixed: it must be zero.  The PRIVATE_FUTEX flag has the value
     0x80 in case private futexes are available and zero otherwise.
     This leads to the following table:

                 |     pshared     |     result
                 | shared  private | shared  private |
     ------------+-----------------+-----------------+
     !avail 0    |     0       0   |     0       0   |
      avail 0x80 |  0x80       0   |     0    0x80   |

     If the pshared value is in locking functions XORed with avail
     we get the expected result.  */
