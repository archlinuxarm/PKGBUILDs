/* This file is compiled into assembly code which is then munged by a sed
   script into two files: crti.s and crtn.s.

   * crti.s puts a function prologue at the beginning of the .init and .fini
   sections and defines global symbols for those addresses, so they can be
   called as functions.

   * crtn.s puts the corresponding function epilogues in the .init and .fini
   sections.

   This differs from what would be generated by the generic code in that
   we save and restore the GP within the function.  In order for linker
   relaxation to work, the value in the GP register on exit from a function
   must be valid for the function entry point.  Normally, a function is
   contained within one object file and this is not an issue, provided
   that the function reloads the gp after making any function calls.
   However, _init and _fini are constructed from pieces of many object
   files, all of which may have different GP values.  So we must reload
   the GP value from crti.o in crtn.o.  */
