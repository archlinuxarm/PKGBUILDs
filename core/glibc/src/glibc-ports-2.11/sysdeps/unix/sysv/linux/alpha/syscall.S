/*
 * This is for COMPATIBILITY with Linux/x86 only.  Linux/Alpha system
 * calls return an error indication in a3.  This allows arbitrary 64bit 
 * values to be returned in v0 (because negative values are not
 * mistaken as error numbers).  However, C allows only one value to
 * be returned, so the interface below folds the error indication passed in
 * a3 back into v0: it sets v0 to -errno if an error occurs.  Thus,
 * no negative 64bit numbers can be returned.  To avoid this problem,
 * use assembly stubs wherever possible/convenient.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * long	syscall(syscall_number, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5)
 *
 * syscall_number = the index of the system call we're invoking
 * arg1-arg5 = up to 5 integer arguments to the system call
 *
 * We need to do some arg shifting: the kernel expects the
 * syscall number in v0 and the first five args in a0-a4.
 *
