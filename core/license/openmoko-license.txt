The Openmoko program uses the following Licenses for its official programs:


-Native Software

Applications: GPLv2 

For all native applications, we use the second version of the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means that we commit ourselves to the 'standard' copyleft license which covers by far the most Free Software programs today. 

Any extension or contribution that somebody makes (and wants to distribute) has therefore to be released under the exact same license. 

The future license compatibility is guaranteed by using the FSF-default "or any later version" statement. 
Header 

The exact following header shall be present in all source code and header files of applications that were entirely and originally developed by the Openmoko project: 
/*

Libraries: LGPLv2.1 

For all native libraries, we use the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1. 

Any extension or contribution that somebody makes (and wants to distribute) has therefore to be released under the exact same license. 

However, while we ourselves are committed to Free Software, we do not want to constrict the use of those libraries by developers of applications who want to create a non-free program. 

The future license compatibility is guaranteed by using the FSF-default "or any later version" statement.
