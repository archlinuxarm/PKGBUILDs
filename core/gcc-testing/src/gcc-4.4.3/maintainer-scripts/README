This directory contains various files used by the gccadmin account on
gcc.gnu.org, mainly for automated tasks such as the daily update of
the date in gcc/DATESTAMP.  There isn't presently any scheme for files
checked in here to be automatically checked out and used by gccadmin,
so the files in CVS and those used by gccadmin must be kept in sync
manually.
