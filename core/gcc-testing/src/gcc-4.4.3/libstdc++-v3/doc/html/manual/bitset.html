	No, you cannot write code of the form
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
      #include &lt;bitset&gt;

      void foo (size_t n)
      {
          std::bitset&lt;n&gt;   bits;
          ....
      } 
   </pre><p>
     because <code class="code">n</code> must be known at compile time.  Your
     compiler is correct; it is not a bug.  That's the way templates
     work.  (Yes, it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a feature.)
   </p><p>
     There are a couple of ways to handle this kind of thing.  Please
     consider all of them before passing judgement.  They include, in
     no particular order:
   </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A very large N in <code class="code">bitset&lt;N&gt;</code>.</p></li><li><p>A container&lt;bool&gt;.</p></li><li><p>Extremely weird solutions.</p></li></ul></div><p>
     <span class="emphasis"><em>A very large N in
     <code class="code">bitset&lt;N&gt;</code>.  </em></span> It has been
     pointed out a few times in newsgroups that N bits only takes up
     (N/8) bytes on most systems, and division by a factor of eight is
     pretty impressive when speaking of memory.  Half a megabyte given
     over to a bitset (recall that there is zero space overhead for
     housekeeping info; it is known at compile time exactly how large
     the set is) will hold over four million bits.  If you're using
     those bits as status flags (e.g.,
     “<span class="quote">changed</span>”/“<span class="quote">unchanged</span>” flags), that's a
     <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of state.
   </p><p>
     You can then keep track of the “<span class="quote">maximum bit used</span>”
     during some testing runs on representative data, make note of how
     many of those bits really need to be there, and then reduce N to
     a smaller number.  Leave some extra space, of course.  (If you
     plan to write code like the incorrect example above, where the
     bitset is a local variable, then you may have to talk your
     compiler into allowing that much stack space; there may be zero
     space overhead, but it's all allocated inside the object.)
   </p><p>
     <span class="emphasis"><em>A container&lt;bool&gt;.  </em></span> The
     Committee made provision for the space savings possible with that
     (N/8) usage previously mentioned, so that you don't have to do
     wasteful things like <code class="code">Container&lt;char&gt;</code> or
     <code class="code">Container&lt;short int&gt;</code>.  Specifically,
     <code class="code">vector&lt;bool&gt;</code> is required to be specialized for
     that space savings.
   </p><p>
     The problem is that <code class="code">vector&lt;bool&gt;</code> doesn't
     behave like a normal vector anymore.  There have been recent
     journal articles which discuss the problems (the ones by Herb
     Sutter in the May and July/August 1999 issues of C++ Report cover
     it well).  Future revisions of the ISO C++ Standard will change
     the requirement for <code class="code">vector&lt;bool&gt;</code>
     specialization.  In the meantime, <code class="code">deque&lt;bool&gt;</code>
     is recommended (although its behavior is sane, you probably will
     not get the space savings, but the allocation scheme is different
     than that of vector).
   </p><p>
     <span class="emphasis"><em>Extremely weird solutions.  </em></span> If
     you have access to the compiler and linker at runtime, you can do
     something insane, like figuring out just how many bits you need,
     then writing a temporary source code file.  That file contains an
     instantiation of <code class="code">bitset</code> for the required number of
     bits, inside some wrapper functions with unchanging signatures.
     Have your program then call the compiler on that file using
     Position Independent Code, then open the newly-created object
     file and load those wrapper functions.  You'll have an
     instantiation of <code class="code">bitset&lt;N&gt;</code> for the exact
     <code class="code">N</code> that you need at the time.  Don't forget to delete
     the temporary files.  (Yes, this <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be, and
     <span class="emphasis"><em>has been</em></span>, done.)
   </p><p>
     This would be the approach of either a visionary genius or a
     raving lunatic, depending on your programming and management
     style.  Probably the latter.
   </p><p>
     Which of the above techniques you use, if any, are up to you and
     your intended application.  Some time/space profiling is
     indicated if it really matters (don't just guess).  And, if you
     manage to do anything along the lines of the third category, the
     author would love to hear from you...
   </p><p>
     Also note that the implementation of bitset used in libstdc++ has
     <a class="ulink" href="../ext/sgiexts.html#ch23" target="_top">some extensions</a>.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="associative.bitset.type_string"></a>Type String</h3></div></div></div><p>
      </p><p>
     Bitmasks do not take char* nor const char* arguments in their
     constructors.  This is something of an accident, but you can read
     about the problem: follow the library's “<span class="quote">Links</span>” from
     the homepage, and from the C++ information “<span class="quote">defect
     reflector</span>” link, select the library issues list.  Issue
     number 116 describes the problem.
   </p><p>
     For now you can simply make a temporary string object using the
     constructor expression:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
      std::bitset&lt;5&gt; b ( std::string(“<span class="quote">10110</span>”) );
   </pre><p>
     instead of
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
      std::bitset&lt;5&gt; b ( “<span class="quote">10110</span>” );    // invalid
    </pre></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="associative.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="associative.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="containers_and_c.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 17. Associative </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../spine.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 18. Interacting with C</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
