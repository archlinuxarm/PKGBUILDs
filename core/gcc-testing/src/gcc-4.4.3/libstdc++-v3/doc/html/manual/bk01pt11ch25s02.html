Particularly
      the fact that C++ may not, in fact, have anything to do with it?
   </p><p>The rules for buffering can be a little odd, but they aren't any
      different from those of C.  (Maybe that's why they can be a bit
      odd.)  Many people think that writing a newline to an output
      stream automatically flushes the output buffer.  This is true only
      when the output stream is, in fact, a terminal and not a file
      or some other device -- and <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> may not even be true
      since C++ says nothing about files nor terminals.  All of that is
      system-dependent.  (The "newline-buffer-flushing only occurring
      on terminals" thing is mostly true on Unix systems, though.)
   </p><p>Some people also believe that sending <code class="code">endl</code> down an
      output stream only writes a newline.  This is incorrect; after a
      newline is written, the buffer is also flushed.  Perhaps this
      is the effect you want when writing to a screen -- get the text
      out as soon as possible, etc -- but the buffering is largely
      wasted when doing this to a file:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
   output &lt;&lt; "a line of text" &lt;&lt; endl;
   output &lt;&lt; some_data_variable &lt;&lt; endl;
   output &lt;&lt; "another line of text" &lt;&lt; endl; </pre><p>The proper thing to do in this case to just write the data out
      and let the libraries and the system worry about the buffering.
      If you need a newline, just write a newline:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
   output &lt;&lt; "a line of text\n"
          &lt;&lt; some_data_variable &lt;&lt; '\n'
          &lt;&lt; "another line of text\n"; </pre><p>I have also joined the output statements into a single statement.
      You could make the code prettier by moving the single newline to
      the start of the quoted text on the last line, for example.
   </p><p>If you do need to flush the buffer above, you can send an
      <code class="code">endl</code> if you also need a newline, or just flush the buffer
      yourself:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
   output &lt;&lt; ...... &lt;&lt; flush;    // can use std::flush manipulator
   output.flush();               // or call a member fn </pre><p>On the other hand, there are times when writing to a file should
      be like writing to standard error; no buffering should be done 
      because the data needs to appear quickly (a prime example is a
      log file for security-related information).  The way to do this is
      just to turn off the buffering <span class="emphasis"><em>before any I/O operations at
      all</em></span> have been done (note that opening counts as an I/O operation):
   </p><pre class="programlisting">
   std::ofstream    os;
   std::ifstream    is;
   int   i;

   os.rdbuf()-&gt;pubsetbuf(0,0);
   is.rdbuf()-&gt;pubsetbuf(0,0);

   os.open("/foo/bar/baz");
   is.open("/qux/quux/quuux");
   ...
   os &lt;&lt; "this data is written immediately\n";
   is &gt;&gt; i;   // and this will probably cause a disk read </pre><p>Since all aspects of buffering are handled by a streambuf-derived
      member, it is necessary to get at that member with <code class="code">rdbuf()</code>.
      Then the public version of <code class="code">setbuf</code> can be called.  The 
      arguments are the same as those for the Standard C I/O Library
      function (a buffer area followed by its size).
   </p><p>A great deal of this is implementation-dependent.  For example,
      <code class="code">streambuf</code> does not specify any actions for its own 
      <code class="code">setbuf()</code>-ish functions; the classes derived from
      <code class="code">streambuf</code> each define behavior that "makes 
      sense" for that class:  an argument of (0,0) turns off buffering
      for <code class="code">filebuf</code> but does nothing at all for its siblings
      <code class="code">stringbuf</code> and <code class="code">strstreambuf</code>, and specifying
      anything other than (0,0) has varying effects.
      User-defined classes derived from <code class="code">streambuf</code> can
      do whatever they want.  (For <code class="code">filebuf</code> and arguments for
      <code class="code">(p,s)</code> other than zeros, libstdc++ does what you'd expect:
      the first <code class="code">s</code> bytes of <code class="code">p</code> are used as a buffer,
      which you must allocate and deallocate.)
   </p><p>A last reminder:  there are usually more buffers involved than
      just those at the language/library level.  Kernel buffers, disk
      buffers, and the like will also have an effect.  Inspecting and
      changing those are system-dependent.
