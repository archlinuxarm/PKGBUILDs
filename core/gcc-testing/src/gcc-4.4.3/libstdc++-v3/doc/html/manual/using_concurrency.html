      of multithreaded applications which use the Standard C++
      library.  This information is GCC-specific since the C++
      standard does not address matters of multithreaded applications.
   </p><div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="manual.intro.using.concurrency.prereq"></a>Prerequisites</h3></div></div></div><p>All normal disclaimers aside, multithreaded C++ application are
      only supported when libstdc++ and all user code was built with
      compilers which report (via <code class="code"> gcc/g++ -v </code>) the same thread
      model and that model is not <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span>.  As long as your
      final application is actually single-threaded, then it should be
      safe to mix user code built with a thread model of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> with a libstdc++ and other C++ libraries built
      with another thread model useful on the platform.  Other mixes
      may or may not work but are not considered supported.  (Thus, if
      you distribute a shared C++ library in binary form only, it may
      be best to compile it with a GCC configured with
      --enable-threads for maximal interchangeability and usefulness
      with a user population that may have built GCC with either
      --enable-threads or --disable-threads.)
   </p><p>When you link a multithreaded application, you will probably
      need to add a library or flag to g++.  This is a very
      non-standardized area of GCC across ports.  Some ports support a
      special flag (the spelling isn't even standardized yet) to add
      all required macros to a compilation (if any such flags are
      required then you must provide the flag for all compilations not
      just linking) and link-library additions and/or replacements at
      link time.  The documentation is weak.  Here is a quick summary
      to display how ad hoc this is: On Solaris, both -pthreads and
      -threads (with subtly different meanings) are honored.  On OSF,
      -pthread and -threads (with subtly different meanings) are
      honored.  On Linux/i386, -pthread is honored.  On FreeBSD,
      -pthread is honored.  Some other ports use other switches.
      AFAIK, none of this is properly documented anywhere other than
      in ``gcc -dumpspecs'' (look at lib and cpp entries).

We currently use the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html" target="_top">SGI STL</a> definition of thread safety.
</p><p>The library strives to be thread-safe when all of the following
         conditions are met:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The system's libc is itself thread-safe,
       </p></li><li><p>
	   The compiler in use reports a thread model other than
	   'single'. This can be tested via output from <code class="code">gcc
	   -v</code>. Multi-thread capable versions of gcc output

	 Requisite command-line flags are used for atomic operations
	 and threading. Examples of this include <code class="code">-pthread</code>
	 and <code class="code">-march=native</code>, although specifics vary

	 Dependent Options</a>.
       </p></li><li><p>
	   An implementation of atomicity.h functions
           exists for the architecture in question. See the internals documentation for more <a class="ulink" href="../ext/concurrence.html" target="_top">details</a>.
       </p></li></ul></div><p>The user-code must guard against concurrent method calls which may
         access any particular library object's state.  Typically, the
         application programmer may infer what object locks must be held
         based on the objects referenced in a method call.  Without getting
         into great detail, here is an example which requires user-level
         locks:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
     library_class_a shared_object_a;

     thread_main () {
       library_class_b *object_b = new library_class_b;
       shared_object_a.add_b (object_b);   // must hold lock for shared_object_a
       shared_object_a.mutate ();          // must hold lock for shared_object_a
     }

     // Multiple copies of thread_main() are started in independent threads.</pre><p>Under the assumption that object_a and object_b are never exposed to
         another thread, here is an example that should not require any
         user-level locks:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
     thread_main () {
       library_class_a object_a;
       library_class_b *object_b = new library_class_b;
       object_a.add_b (object_b);
       object_a.mutate ();
     } </pre><p>All library objects are safe to use in a multithreaded program as
         long as each thread carefully locks out access by any other
         thread while it uses any object visible to another thread, i.e.,
         treat library objects like any other shared resource.  In general,
         this requirement includes both read and write access to objects;
         unless otherwise documented as safe, do not assume that two threads
         may access a shared standard library object at the same time.

      and the

      access</a> (you might not think of an I/O stream as a container, but

   </p><p>This gets a bit tricky.  Please read carefully, and bear with me.
   </p><div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="concurrency.io.structure"></a>Structure</h4></div></div></div><p>A wrapper
      type called <code class="code">__basic_file</code> provides our abstraction layer
      for the <code class="code">std::filebuf</code> classes.  Nearly all decisions dealing
      with actual input and output must be made in <code class="code">__basic_file</code>.
   </p><p>A generic locking mechanism is somewhat in place at the filebuf layer,
      but is not used in the current code.  Providing locking at any higher
      level is akin to providing locking within containers, and is not done
      for the same reasons (see the links above).
   </p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="concurrency.io.defaults"></a>Defaults</h4></div></div></div><p>The __basic_file type is simply a collection of small wrappers around
      the C stdio layer (again, see the link under Structure).  We do no
      locking ourselves, but simply pass through to calls to <code class="code">fopen</code>,
      <code class="code">fwrite</code>, and so forth.
   </p><p>So, for 3.0, the question of "is multithreading safe for I/O" 
      must be answered with, "is your platform's C library threadsafe
      for I/O?"  Some are by default, some are not; many offer multiple
      implementations of the C library with varying tradeoffs of threadsafety
      and efficiency.  You, the programmer, are always required to take care
      with multiple threads.
   </p><p>(As an example, the POSIX standard requires that C stdio FILE*
       operations are atomic.  POSIX-conforming C libraries (e.g, on Solaris
       and GNU/Linux) have an internal mutex to serialize operations on
       FILE*s.  However, you still need to not do stupid things like calling
       <code class="code">fclose(fs)</code> in one thread followed by an access of
       <code class="code">fs</code> in another.)
   </p><p>So, if your platform's C library is threadsafe, then your
      <code class="code">fstream</code> I/O operations will be threadsafe at the lowest
      level.  For higher-level operations, such as manipulating the data
      contained in the stream formatting classes (e.g., setting up callbacks
      inside an <code class="code">std::ofstream</code>), you need to guard such accesses
      like any other critical shared resource.
   </p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="concurrency.io.future"></a>Future</h4></div></div></div><p> A
      second choice may be available for I/O implementations:  libio.  This is
      disabled by default, and in fact will not currently work due to other
      issues.  It will be revisited, however.
   </p><p>The libio code is a subset of the guts of the GNU libc (glibc) I/O
      implementation.  When libio is in use, the <code class="code">__basic_file</code>
      type is basically derived from FILE.  (The real situation is more
      complex than that... it's derived from an internal type used to
      implement FILE.  See libio/libioP.h to see scary things done with
      vtbls.)  The result is that there is no "layer" of C stdio
      to go through; the filebuf makes calls directly into the same
      functions used to implement <code class="code">fread</code>, <code class="code">fwrite</code>,
      and so forth, using internal data structures.  (And when I say
      "makes calls directly," I mean the function is literally
      replaced by a jump into an internal function.  Fast but frightening.
      *grin*)
   </p><p>Also, the libio internal locks are used.  This requires pulling in
      large chunks of glibc, such as a pthreads implementation, and is one
      of the issues preventing widespread use of libio as the libstdc++
      cstdio implementation.
   </p><p>But we plan to make this work, at least as an option if not a future
      default.  Platforms running a copy of glibc with a recent-enough
      version will see calls from libstdc++ directly into the glibc already
      installed.  For other platforms, a copy of the libio subsection will
      be built and included in libstdc++.

      easily write one to perform your own forms of locking, to solve your
      "interesting" problems.

      multithreaded applications which use Standard C++ containers.
      All information in this section is current as of the gcc 3.0
      release and all later point releases.  Although earlier gcc
      releases had a different approach to threading configuration and
      proper compilation, the basic code design rules presented here
      were similar.  For information on all other aspects of
      multithreading as it relates to libstdc++, including details on
      the proper compilation of threaded code (and compatibility between
      threaded and non-threaded code), see Chapter 17.
   </p><p>Two excellent pages to read when working with the Standard C++
      containers and threads are
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html" target="_top">SGI's
      http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/thread_safety.html</a> and
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Allocators.html" target="_top">SGI's
      http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Allocators.html</a>.
   </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>However, please ignore all discussions about the user-level
      configuration of the lock implementation inside the STL
      container-memory allocator on those pages.  For the sake of this
      discussion, libstdc++ configures the SGI STL implementation,
      not you.  This is quite different from how gcc pre-3.0 worked.
      In particular, past advice was for people using g++ to
      explicitly define _PTHREADS or other macros or port-specific
      compilation options on the command line to get a thread-safe
      STL.  This is no longer required for any port and should no
      longer be done unless you really know what you are doing and
      assume all responsibility.</em></span>
   </p><p>Since the container implementation of libstdc++ uses the SGI
      code, we use the same definition of thread safety as SGI when
      discussing design.  A key point that beginners may miss is the
      fourth major paragraph of the first page mentioned above
      ("For most clients,"...), which points out that
      locking must nearly always be done outside the container, by
      client code (that'd be you, not us).  There is a notable
      exceptions to this rule.  Allocators called while a container or
      element is constructed uses an internal lock obtained and
      released solely within libstdc++ code (in fact, this is the
      reason STL requires any knowledge of the thread configuration).
   </p><p>For implementing a container which does its own locking, it is
      trivial to provide a wrapper class which obtains the lock (as
      SGI suggests), performs the container operation, and then
      releases the lock.  This could be templatized <span class="emphasis"><em>to a certain
      extent</em></span>, on the underlying container and/or a locking
      mechanism.  Trying to provide a catch-all general template
      solution would probably be more trouble than it's worth.
   </p><p>The STL implementation is currently configured to use the
      high-speed caching memory allocator.  Some people like to
      test and/or normally run threaded programs with a different
      default.  For all details about how to globally override this
      at application run-time see <a class="ulink" href="../ext/howto.html#3" target="_top">here</a>.
   </p><p>There is a better way (not standardized yet):  It is possible to
      force the malloc-based allocator on a per-case-basis for some
      application code.  The library team generally believes that this
      is a better way to tune an application for high-speed using this
      implementation of the STL.  There is
