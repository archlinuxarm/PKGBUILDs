      especially towards the end.  Trust me.
   </p><p>Beginners usually have a little trouble understand the whole
      'past-the-end' thing, until they remember their early algebra classes
      (see, they <span class="emphasis"><em>told</em></span> you that stuff would come in handy!) and
      the concept of half-open ranges.
   </p><p>First, some history, and a reminder of some of the funkier rules in
      C and C++ for builtin arrays.  The following rules have always been
      true for both languages:
   </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>You can point anywhere in the array, <span class="emphasis"><em>or to the first element
          past the end of the array</em></span>.  A pointer that points to one
          past the end of the array is guaranteed to be as unique as a
          pointer to somewhere inside the array, so that you can compare
          such pointers safely.
	</p></li><li><p>You can only dereference a pointer that points into an array.
          If your array pointer points outside the array -- even to just
          one past the end -- and you dereference it, Bad Things happen.
	</p></li><li><p>Strictly speaking, simply pointing anywhere else invokes
          undefined behavior.  Most programs won't puke until such a
          pointer is actually dereferenced, but the standards leave that
          up to the platform.
	</p></li></ol></div><p>The reason this past-the-end addressing was allowed is to make it
      easy to write a loop to go over an entire array, e.g.,
      while (*d++ = *s++);.
   </p><p>So, when you think of two pointers delimiting an array, don't think
      of them as indexing 0 through n-1.  Think of them as <span class="emphasis"><em>boundary
      markers</em></span>:
   </p><pre class="programlisting">

   beginning            end
     |                   |
     |                   |               This is bad.  Always having to
     |                   |               remember to add or subtract one.
     |                   |               Off-by-one bugs very common here.
     V                   V
        array of N elements
     |---|---|--...--|---|---|
     | 0 | 1 |  ...  |N-2|N-1|
     |---|---|--...--|---|---|

     ^                       ^
     |                       |
     |                       |           This is good.  This is safe.  This
     |                       |           is guaranteed to work.  Just don't
     |                       |           dereference 'end'.
   beginning                end

   </pre><p>See?  Everything between the boundary markers is part of the array.
      Simple.
   </p><p>Now think back to your junior-high school algebra course, when you
      were learning how to draw graphs.  Remember that a graph terminating
      with a solid dot meant, "Everything up through this point,"
      and a graph terminating with an open dot meant, "Everything up
      to, but not including, this point," respectively called closed
      and open ranges?  Remember how closed ranges were written with
      brackets, <span class="emphasis"><em>[a,b]</em></span>, and open ranges were written with parentheses,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>(a,b)</em></span>?
   </p><p>The boundary markers for arrays describe a <span class="emphasis"><em>half-open range</em></span>,
      starting with (and including) the first element, and ending with (but
      not including) the last element:  <span class="emphasis"><em>[beginning,end)</em></span>.  See, I
      told you it would be simple in the end.
   </p><p>Iterators, and everything working with iterators, follows this same
      time-honored tradition.  A container's <code class="code">begin()</code> method returns
      an iterator referring to the first element, and its <code class="code">end()</code>
      method returns a past-the-end iterator, which is guaranteed to be
      unique and comparable against any other iterator pointing into the
      middle of the container.
   </p><p>Container constructors, container methods, and algorithms, all take
      pairs of iterators describing a range of values on which to operate.
      All of these ranges are half-open ranges, so you pass the beginning
      iterator as the starting parameter, and the one-past-the-end iterator
      as the finishing parameter.
   </p><p>This generalizes very well.  You can operate on sub-ranges quite
      easily this way; functions accepting a <span class="emphasis"><em>[first,last)</em></span> range
      don't know or care whether they are the boundaries of an entire {array,
      sequence, container, whatever}, or whether they only enclose a few
      elements from the center.  This approach also makes zero-length
      sequences very simple to recognize:  if the two endpoints compare
      equal, then the {array, sequence, container, whatever} is empty.
   </p><p>Just don't dereference <code class="code">end()</code>.
