<title>Allocators</title>

<para>
 Memory management for Standard Library entities is encapsulated in a
 class template called <classname>allocator</classname>. The
 <classname>allocator</classname> abstraction is used throughout the
 library in <classname>string</classname>, container classes,
 algorithms, and parts of iostreams. This class, and base classes of
 it, are the superset of available free store (<quote>heap</quote>)
 management classes.

       When you add elements to a container, and the container must
       allocate more memory to hold them, the container makes the
       request via its <type>Allocator</type> template
       parameter, which is usually aliased to
       <type>allocator_type</type>.  This includes adding chars
       to the string class, which acts as a regular STL container in
       this respect.

<sect2 id="allocator.design_issues" xreflabel="allocator.design_issues">
<title>Design Issues</title>

  <para>
    The easiest way of fulfilling the requirements is to call
    <function>operator new</function> each time a container needs
    memory, and to call <function>operator delete</function> each time
    the container releases memory. This method may be <ulink
    url="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2001-05/msg00105.html">slower</ulink>
    than caching the allocations and re-using previously-allocated
    memory, but has the advantage of working correctly across a wide
    variety of hardware and operating systems, including large
    clusters. The <classname>__gnu_cxx::new_allocator</classname>
    implements the simple operator new and operator delete semantics,
    while <classname>__gnu_cxx::malloc_allocator</classname>
    implements much the same thing, only with the C language functions
    <function>std::malloc</function> and <function>free</function>.
  </para>

  <para> 
    Another approach is to use intelligence within the allocator
    class to cache allocations. This extra machinery can take a variety
    of forms: a bitmap index, an index into an exponentially increasing
    power-of-two-sized buckets, or simpler fixed-size pooling cache.
    The cache is shared among all the containers in the program: when
    your program's <classname>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</classname> gets
  cut in half and frees a bunch of its storage, that memory can be
  reused by the private
  <classname>std::list&lt;WonkyWidget&gt;</classname> brought in from
  a KDE library that you linked against.  And operators
  <function>new</function> and <function>delete</function> are not
  always called to pass the memory on, either, which is a speed
  bonus. Examples of allocators that use these techniques are
  <classname>__gnu_cxx::bitmap_allocator</classname>,
  <classname>__gnu_cxx::pool_allocator</classname>, and
  <classname>__gnu_cxx::__mt_alloc</classname>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Depending on the implementation techniques used, the underlying
    operating system, and compilation environment, scaling caching
    allocators can be tricky. In particular, order-of-destruction and
    order-of-creation for memory pools may be difficult to pin down
    with certainty, which may create problems when used with plugins
    or loading and unloading shared objects in memory. As such, using
    caching allocators on systems that do not support
    <function>abi::__cxa_atexit</function> is not recommended.

    <title>Interface Design</title>

   <para>
     The only allocator interface that
     is support is the standard C++ interface. As such, all STL

     been modified to support this change.

     The class <classname>allocator</classname> just has typedef,
   constructor, and rebind members. It inherits from one of the
   high-speed extension allocators, covered below. Thus, all
   allocation and deallocation depends on the base class.

   <para> 
     It's difficult to pick an allocation strategy that will provide
   maximum utility, without excessively penalizing some behavior. In

    <title>Disabling Memory Caching</title>

    <para> 
      In use, <classname>allocator</classname> may allocate and
      deallocate using implementation-specified strategies and
      heuristics. Because of this, every call to an allocator object's
      <function>allocate</function> member function may not actually
      call the global operator new. This situation is also duplicated
      for calls to the <function>deallocate</function> member
      function.
    </para>

   <para> 
     This can be confusing. 
   </para>

   <para> 
     In particular, this can make debugging memory errors more
     difficult, especially when using third party tools like valgrind or
     debug versions of <function>new</function>.
   </para>

   <para> 
     There are various ways to solve this problem. One would be to use
     a custom allocator that just called operators
     <function>new</function> and <function>delete</function>
     directly, for every allocation. (See
     <filename>include/ext/new_allocator.h</filename>, for instance.)
     However, that option would involve changing source code to use
     a non-default allocator. Another option is to force the
     default allocator to remove caching and pools, and to directly
     allocate with every call of <function>allocate</function> and
     directly deallocate with every call of
     <function>deallocate</function>, regardless of efficiency. As it
     turns out, this last option is also available.
   </para>


   <para>
     To globally disable memory caching within the library for the
     default allocator, merely set
     <constant>GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW</constant> (with any value) in the
     system's environment before running the program. If your program
     crashes with <constant>GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW</constant> in the
     environment, it likely means that you linked against objects
     built against the older library (objects which might still using the
     cached allocations...).

<sect2 id="allocator.using" xreflabel="allocator.using">
<title>Using a Specific Allocator</title>

   <para>
     You can specify different memory management schemes on a
     per-container basis, by overriding the default
     <type>Allocator</type> template parameter.  For example, an easy
      (but non-portable) method of specifying that only <function>malloc</function> or <function>free</function>
      should be used instead of the default node allocator is:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
    std::list &lt;int, __gnu_cxx::malloc_allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt;  malloc_list;</programlisting>
    <para>
      Likewise, a debugging form of whichever allocator is currently in use:
    </para>
      <programlisting>
    std::deque &lt;int, __gnu_cxx::debug_allocator&lt;std::allocator&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt;  debug_deque;

    not subtractions, would be permissible.
