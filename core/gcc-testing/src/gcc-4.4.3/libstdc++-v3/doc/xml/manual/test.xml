<para>
  The directory <emphasis>libsrcdir/testsuite</emphasis> contains the
  individual test cases organized in sub-directories corresponding to
  chapters of the C++ standard (detailed below), the dejagnu test
  harness support files, and sources to various testsuite utilities
  that are packaged in a separate testing library.
</para>

<para> 
  All test cases for functionality required by the runtime components
  of the C++ standard (ISO 14882) are files within the following
  directories.
</para>

   <programlisting>
17_intro
18_support
19_diagnostics
20_util
21_strings
22_locale
23_containers
25_algorithms
26_numerics
27_io
   </programlisting>

   <para>
      In addition, the following directories include test files:
   </para>

   <programlisting>
tr1		  Tests for components as described by the Technical Report on Standard Library Extensions (TR1).
backward	  Tests for backwards compatibility and deprecated features.
demangle	  Tests for __cxa_demangle, the IA 64 C++ ABI demangler
ext		  Tests for extensions.
performance	  Tests for performance analysis, and performance regressions.
thread		  Tests for threads.
   </programlisting>
   
   <para>
      Some directories don't have test files, but instead contain
      auxiliary information (<ulink url="#internals">more information</ulink>):
   </para>

   <programlisting>
config		  Files for the dejagnu test harness.
lib		  Files for the dejagnu test harness.
libstdc++*     	  Files for the dejagnu test harness.
data		  Sample text files for testing input and output.
util		  Files for libtestc++, utilities and testing routines.
   </programlisting>

   <para>
      Within a directory that includes test files, there may be
      additional subdirectories, or files.  Originally, test cases
      were appended to one file that represented a particular section
      of the chapter under test, and was named accordingly. For
      instance, to test items related to <code> 21.3.6.1 -
      basic_string::find [lib.string::find]</code> in the standard,
      the following was used:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
21_strings/find.cc
   </programlisting>   
   <para>
      However, that practice soon became a liability as the test cases
      became huge and unwieldy, and testing new or extended
      functionality (like wide characters or named locales) became
      frustrating, leading to aggressive pruning of test cases on some
      platforms that covered up implementation errors. Now, the test
      suite has a policy of one file, one test case, which solves the
      above issues and gives finer grained results and more manageable
      error debugging. As an example, the test case quoted above
      becomes:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
21_strings/basic_string/find/char/1.cc
21_strings/basic_string/find/char/2.cc
21_strings/basic_string/find/char/3.cc

21_strings/basic_string/find/wchar_t/2.cc
21_strings/basic_string/find/wchar_t/3.cc
   </programlisting>   

   <para>
      All new tests should be written with the policy of one test
      case, one file in mind. 
   </para>

      There are two ways to run on a simulator: set up DEJAGNU to point to a

    Example flags to pass down for various embedded builds are as follows:

      You can run the tests with a compiler and library that have
      already been installed.  Make sure that the compiler (e.g.,
      <code>g++</code>) is in your <code>PATH</code>.  If you are
      using shared libraries, then you must also ensure that the
      directory containing the shared version of libstdc++ is in your
      <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, or equivalent.  If your GCC source
      tree is at <code>/path/to/gcc</code>, then you can run the tests
      as follows:
    </para>

<programlisting>
runtest --tool libstdc++ --srcdir=/path/to/gcc/libstdc++-v3/testsuite
</programlisting>

    <para>
      The testsuite will create a number of files in the directory in
      which you run this command,.  Some of those files might use the
      same name as files created by other testsuites (like the ones
      for GCC and G++), so you should not try to run all the
      testsuites in parallel from the same directory.

      In addition, there are some testing options that are mostly of
      interest to library maintainers and system integrators. As such,
      these tests may not work on all cpu and host combinations, and

   For a test that needs to take advantage of the dejagnu test

   expected.  New test cases should be written with the new style
   DejaGnu framework in mind.
   </para>

   <para>
    To ease transition, here is the list of dg-keyword documentation
    lifted from dg.exp.
   </para>

<programlisting>
# The currently supported options are:
#
# dg-prms-id N
#	set prms_id to N
#
# dg-options "options ..." [{ target selector }]
#	specify special options to pass to the tool (eg: compiler)
#
# dg-do do-what-keyword [{ target/xfail selector }]
#	`do-what-keyword' is tool specific and is passed unchanged to
#	${tool}-dg-test.  An example is gcc where `keyword' can be any of:
#	preprocess|compile|assemble|link|run
#	and will do one of: produce a .i, produce a .s, produce a .o,
#	produce an a.out, or produce an a.out and run it (the default is
#	compile).
#
# dg-error regexp comment [{ target/xfail selector } [{.|0|linenum}]]
#	indicate an error message &lt;regexp&gt; is expected on this line
#	(the test fails if it doesn't occur)
#	Linenum=0 for general tool messages (eg: -V arg missing).
#	"." means the current line.
#
# dg-warning regexp comment [{ target/xfail selector } [{.|0|linenum}]]
#	indicate a warning message &lt;regexp&gt; is expected on this line
#	(the test fails if it doesn't occur)
#
# dg-bogus regexp comment [{ target/xfail selector } [{.|0|linenum}]]
#	indicate a bogus error message &lt;regexp&gt; use to occur here
#	(the test fails if it does occur)
#
# dg-build regexp comment [{ target/xfail selector }]
#	indicate the build use to fail for some reason
#	(errors covered here include bad assembler generated, tool crashes,
#	and link failures)
#	(the test fails if it does occur)
#
# dg-excess-errors comment [{ target/xfail selector }]
#	indicate excess errors are expected (any line)
#	(this should only be used sparingly and temporarily)
#
# dg-output regexp [{ target selector }]
#	indicate the expected output of the program is &lt;regexp&gt;
#	(there may be multiple occurrences of this, they are concatenated)
#
# dg-final { tcl code }
#	add some tcl code to be run at the end
#	(there may be multiple occurrences of this, they are concatenated)
#	(unbalanced braces must be \-escaped)
#
# "{ target selector }" is a list of expressions that determine whether the
# test succeeds or fails for a particular target, or in some cases whether the
# option applies for a particular target.  If the case of `dg-do' it specifies
# whether the test case is even attempted on the specified target.
#
# The target selector is always optional.  The format is one of:
#
# { xfail *-*-* ... } - the test is expected to fail for the given targets
# { target *-*-* ... } - the option only applies to the given targets
#
# At least one target must be specified, use *-*-* for "all targets".
# At present it is not possible to specify both `xfail' and `target'.
# "native" may be used in place of "*-*-*".

Example 1: Testing compilation only
// { dg-do compile }

Example 2: Testing for expected warnings on line 36, which all targets fail
// { dg-warning "string literals" "" { xfail *-*-* } 36

Example 3: Testing for expected warnings on line 36
// { dg-warning "string literals" "" { target *-*-* } 36

Example 4: Testing for compilation errors on line 41
// { dg-do compile }
// { dg-error "no match for" "" { target *-*-* } 41 }

Example 5: Testing with special command line settings, or without the
use of pre-compiled headers, in particular the stdc++.h.gch file. Any
options here will override the DEFAULT_CXXFLAGS and PCH_CXXFLAGS set
up in the normal.exp file.
// { dg-options "-O0" { target *-*-* } }

<para>This is information for those looking at making changes to the testsuite

<para>The first key point when working with dejagnu is the idea of a "tool".
Files, directories, and functions are all implicitly used when they are
named after the tool in use.  Here, the tool will always be "libstdc++".
</para>

<para>The <code>lib</code> subdir contains support routines.  The
<code>lib/libstdc++.exp</code> file ("support library") is loaded
automagically, and must explicitly load the others.  For example, files can
be copied from the core compiler's support directory into <code>lib</code>.
</para>

<para>Some routines in <code>lib/libstdc++.exp</code> are callbacks, some are
our own.  Callbacks must be prefixed with the name of the tool.  To easily
distinguish the others, by convention our own routines are named "v3-*".
</para>

<para>The next key point when working with dejagnu is "test files".  Any
directory whose name starts with the tool name will be searched for test files.
(We have only one.)  In those directories, any <code>.exp</code> file is
considered a test file, and will be run in turn.  Our main test file is called
<code>normal.exp</code>; it runs all the tests in testsuite_files using the
callbacks loaded from the support library.
</para>

<para>The <code>config</code> directory is searched for any particular "target
board" information unique to this library.  This is currently unused and sets
only default variables.
