/* This module implements main driver of compilation process as well as
   few basic interprocedural optimizers.

   The main scope of this file is to act as an interface in between
   tree based frontends and the backend (and middle end)

   The front-end is supposed to use following functionality:

    - cgraph_finalize_function

      This function is called once front-end has parsed whole body of function
      and it is certain that the function body nor the declaration will change.

      (There is one exception needed for implementing GCC extern inline
	function.)

    - varpool_finalize_variable

      This function has same behavior as the above but is used for static
      variables.

    - cgraph_finalize_compilation_unit

      This function is called once (source level) compilation unit is finalized
      and it will no longer change.

      In the the call-graph construction and local function
      analysis takes place here.  Bodies of unreachable functions are released
      to conserve memory usage.

      The function can be called multiple times when multiple source level
      compilation units are combined (such as in C frontend)

    - cgraph_optimize

      In this unit-at-a-time compilation the intra procedural analysis takes
      place here.  In particular the static functions whose address is never
      taken are marked as local.  Backend can then use this information to
      modify calling conventions, do better inlining or similar optimizations.

    - cgraph_mark_needed_node
    - varpool_mark_needed_node

      When function or variable is referenced by some hidden way the call-graph
      data structure must be updated accordingly by this function.
      There should be little need to call this function and all the references
      should be made explicit to cgraph code.  At present these functions are
      used by C++ frontend to explicitly mark the keyed methods.

    - analyze_expr callback

      This function is responsible for lowering tree nodes not understood by
      generic code into understandable ones or alternatively marking
      callgraph and varpool nodes referenced by the as needed.

      ??? On the tree-ssa genericizing should take place here and we will avoid
      need for these hooks (replacing them by genericizing hook)

        Analyzing of all functions is deferred
	to cgraph_finalize_compilation_unit and expansion into cgraph_optimize.

	In cgraph_finalize_compilation_unit the reachable functions are
	analyzed.  During analysis the call-graph edges from reachable
	functions are constructed and their destinations are marked as
	reachable.  References to functions and variables are discovered too
	and variables found to be needed output to the assembly file.  Via
	mark_referenced call in assemble_variable functions referenced by
	static variables are noticed too.

	The intra-procedural information is produced and its existence
	indicated by global_info_ready.  Once this flag is set it is impossible
	to change function from !reachable to reachable and thus
	assemble_variable no longer call mark_referenced.

	Finally the call-graph is topologically sorted and all reachable functions
	that has not been completely inlined or are not external are output.

	??? It is possible that reference to function or variable is optimized
	out.  We can not deal with this nicely because topological order is not
	suitable for it.  For tree-ssa we may consider another pass doing
	optimization and re-discovering reachable functions.

	??? Reorganize code so variables are output very last and only if they
	really has been referenced by produced code, so we catch more cases
	where reference has been optimized out.  */
