   Conversion between integer and pointer is represented with CONVERT_EXPR.
   Converting integer to real uses FLOAT_EXPR
   and real to integer uses FIX_TRUNC_EXPR.

   Here is a list of all the functions that assume that widening and
   narrowing is always done with a NOP_EXPR:
     In convert.c, convert_to_integer.
     In c-typeck.c, build_binary_op (boolean ops), and
	c_common_truthvalue_conversion.
     In expr.c: expand_expr, for operands of a MULT_EXPR.
     In fold-const.c: fold.
     In tree.c: get_narrower and get_unwidened.  */
