--  This version of Ada.Exceptions is a full Ada 95 version. It omits Ada 2005
--  features such as the additional definitions of Exception_Name returning
--  Wide_[Wide_]String.

--  It is used for building the compiler and the basic tools, since these
--  builds may be done with bootstrap compilers that cannot handle these
--  additions. The full version of Ada.Exceptions can be found in the files
--  a-except-2005.ads/adb, and is used for all other builds where full Ada
--  2005 functionality is required. In particular, it is used for building
--  run times on all targets.

   --  only JGNAT uses this. See 4jexcept.ads for details. The pragma Export
   --  allows this routine to be accessed elsewhere in the run-time, even
   --  though it is in the private part of this package (it is not allowed
   --  to be in the visible part, since this is set by the reference manual).

   function Exception_Name_Simple (X : Exception_Occurrence) return String;
   --  Like Exception_Name, but returns the simple non-qualified name of the

   --  Current_Exceptions (the DEC compatible unit). It is called from the

   --  private barrier, so we can place this function in the private part

   --  Raise_Exception_Always if it can determine this is the case. The Export
   --  allows this routine to be accessed from Pure units.

   --  This routine is used to raise an exception from a signal handler. The
   --  signal handler has already stored the machine state (i.e. the state that
   --  corresponds to the location at which the signal was raised). E is the
   --  Exception_Id specifying what exception is being raised, and M is a
   --  pointer to a null-terminated string which is the message to be raised.
   --  Note that this routine never returns, so it is permissible to simply
   --  jump to this routine, rather than call it. This may be appropriate for
   --  systems where the right way to get out of signal handler is to alter the
   --  PC value in the machine state or in some other way ask the operating
   --  system to return here rather than to the original location.

     (X : Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Occurrence);
   pragma No_Return (Raise_From_Controlled_Operation);
   --  Raise Program_Error, providing information about X (an exception
   --  raised during a controlled operation) in the exception message.

   procedure Reraise_Occurrence_Always (X : Exception_Occurrence);
   pragma No_Return (Reraise_Occurrence_Always);
   --  This differs from Raise_Occurrence only in that the caller guarantees
   --  that for sure the parameter X is not the null occurrence, and that
   --  therefore this procedure cannot return. The expander uses this routine
   --  in the translation of a raise statement with no parameter (reraise).

   procedure Reraise_Occurrence_No_Defer (X : Exception_Occurrence);
   pragma No_Return (Reraise_Occurrence_No_Defer);
   --  Exactly like Reraise_Occurrence, except that abort is not deferred
   --  before the call and the parameter X is known not to be the null
   --  occurrence. This is used in generated code when it is known that
   --  abort is already deferred.

   -----------------------
   -- Polling Interface --
   -----------------------

   --  The GNAT compiler has an option to generate polling calls to the Poll
   --  routine in this package. Specifying the -gnatP option for a compilation
   --  causes a call to Ada.Exceptions.Poll to be generated on every subprogram
   --  entry and on every iteration of a loop, thus avoiding the possibility of
   --  a case of unbounded time between calls.

   --  This polling interface may be used for instrumentation or debugging
   --  purposes (e.g. implementing watchpoints in software or in the debugger).

   --  In the GNAT technology itself, this interface is used to implement
   --  immediate asynchronous transfer of control and immediate abort on
   --  targets which do not provide for one thread interrupting another.

   --  Note: this used to be in a separate unit called System.Poll, but that
   --  caused horrible circular elaboration problems between System.Poll and
   --  Ada.Exceptions. One way of solving such circularities is unification!

   procedure Poll;
   --  Check for asynchronous abort. Note that we do not inline the body.
   --  This makes the interface more useful for debugging purposes.
