   --  If E is a fixed-point or discrete type, then all the necessary work
   --  to freeze it is completed except for possible setting of the flag
   --  Is_Unsigned_Type, which is done by this procedure. The call has no
   --  effect if the entity E is not a discrete or fixed-point type.

   --  Freeze enumeration type. The Esize field is set as processing
   --  proceeds (i.e. set by default when the type is declared and then
   --  adjusted by rep clauses. What this procedure does is to make sure

   procedure Freeze_Static_Object (E : Entity_Id);
   --  If an object is frozen which has Is_Statically_Allocated set, then

   --  is not called for internal subprograms, for which neither of these

   --  should be frozen when the access type is frozen. This is done when an
   --  allocator is frozen, or an expression that may involve attributes of
   --  the designated type. Otherwise freezing the access type does not freeze
   --  the designated type.

   procedure Generate_Prim_Op_References (Typ : Entity_Id);
   --  For a tagged type, generate implicit references to its primitive
   --  operations, for source navigation.

   procedure Process_Default_Expressions

   --  of default expressions at the point where all types are known to be
   --  frozen. The expressions must be analyzed in full, to make sure that
   --  all error processing is done (they have only been pre-analyzed). If
   --  the expression is not an entity or literal, its analysis may generate
   --  code which must not be executed. In that case we build a function
   --  body to hold that code. This wrapper function serves no other purpose
   --  (it used to be called to evaluate the default, but now the default is
   --  inlined at each point of call).

   procedure Set_Component_Alignment_If_Not_Set (Typ : Entity_Id);
   --  Typ is a record or array type that is being frozen. This routine
   --  sets the default component alignment from the scope stack values
   --  if the alignment is otherwise not specified.

   procedure Check_Debug_Info_Needed (T : Entity_Id);
   --  As each entity is frozen, this routine is called to deal with the
   --  setting of Debug_Info_Needed for the entity. This flag is set if
   --  the entity comes from source, or if we are in Debug_Generated_Code
   --  mode or if the -gnatdV debug flag is set. However, it never sets
   --  the flag if Debug_Info_Off is set. This procedure also ensures that
   --  subsidiary entities have the flag set as required.

   procedure Undelay_Type (T : Entity_Id);
   --  T is a type of a component that we know to be an Itype.
   --  We don't want this to have a Freeze_Node, so ensure it doesn't.

   --  Expr is the expression for an address clause for entity Nam whose type

   --  initialization in the source declaration, check whether the address
