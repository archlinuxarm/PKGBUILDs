--  Simple casing functions

--  This package provides simple casing functions that do not require the
--  overhead of the full casing tables found in Ada.Characters.Handling.

--  Note: actual code is found in System.Case_Util, which is used internally
--  by the GNAT run time. Applications programs should always use this package
--  rather than using System.Case_Util directly.

with System.Case_Util;

package GNAT.Case_Util is
   pragma Pure;
   pragma Elaborate_Body;
   --  The elaborate body is because we have a dummy body to deal with
   --  bootstrap path problems (we used to have a real body, and now we don't
   --  need it any more, but the bootstrap requires that we have a dummy body,
   --  since otherwise the old body gets picked up.

   --  Note: all the following functions handle the full Latin-1 set

   function To_Upper (A : Character) return Character
     renames System.Case_Util.To_Upper;
   --  Converts A to upper case if it is a lower case letter, otherwise
   --  returns the input argument unchanged.

   procedure To_Upper (A : in out String)
     renames System.Case_Util.To_Upper;
   --  Folds all characters of string A to upper case

   function To_Lower (A : Character) return Character
     renames System.Case_Util.To_Lower;
   --  Converts A to lower case if it is an upper case letter, otherwise
   --  returns the input argument unchanged.

   procedure To_Lower (A : in out String)
     renames System.Case_Util.To_Lower;
   --  Folds all characters of string A to lower case

   procedure To_Mixed (A : in out String)
     renames System.Case_Util.To_Mixed;
   --  Converts A to mixed case (i.e. lower case, except for initial
   --  character and any character after an underscore, which are
   --  converted to upper case.
