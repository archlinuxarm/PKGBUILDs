   procedure Adjust_Record_For_Reverse_Bit_Order (R : Entity_Id);
   --  Called from Freeze where R is a record entity for which reverse bit
   --  order is specified and there is at least one component clause. Adjusts
   --  component positions according to Ada 2005 AI-133. Note that this is only
   --  called in Ada 2005 mode. The Ada 95 handling for bit order is entirely
   --  contained in Freeze.

   procedure Initialize;
   --  Initialize internal tables for new compilation

   procedure Set_Enum_Esize (T : Entity_Id);
   --  This routine sets the Esize field for an enumeration type T, based
   --  on the current representation information available for T. Note that
   --  the setting of the RM_Size field is not affected. This routine also
   --  initializes the alignment field to zero.

   function Minimum_Size
     (T      : Entity_Id;
      Biased : Boolean := False) return Nat;
   --  Given an elementary type, determines the minimum number of bits required
   --  to represent all values of the type. This function may not be called
   --  with any other types. If the flag Biased is set True, then the minimum
   --  size calculation that biased representation is used in the case of a
   --  discrete type, e.g. the range 7..8 gives a minimum size of 4 with
   --  Biased set to False, and 1 with Biased set to True. Note that the
   --  biased parameter only has an effect if the type is not biased, it
   --  causes Minimum_Size to indicate the minimum size of an object with
   --  the given type, of the size the type would have if it were biased. If
   --  the type is already biased, then Minimum_Size returns the biased size,
   --  regardless of the setting of Biased. Also, fixed-point types are never
   --  biased in the current implementation. If the size is not known at
   --  compile time, this function returns 0.

   procedure Check_Constant_Address_Clause (Expr : Node_Id; U_Ent : Entity_Id);
   --  Expr is an expression for an address clause. This procedure checks
   --  that the expression is constant, in the limited sense that it is safe
   --  to evaluate it at the point the object U_Ent is declared, rather than
   --  at the point of the address clause. The condition for this to be true
   --  is that the expression has no variables, no constants declared after
   --  U_Ent, and no calls to non-pure functions. If this condition is not
   --  met, then an appropriate error message is posted. This check is applied
   --  at the point an object with an address clause is frozen, as well as for
   --  address clauses for tasks and entries.

   procedure Check_Size
     (N      : Node_Id;
      T      : Entity_Id;
      Siz    : Uint;
      Biased : out Boolean);
   --  Called when size Siz is specified for subtype T. This subprogram checks
   --  that the size is appropriate, posting errors on node N as required.
   --  This check is effective for elementary types and bit-packed arrays.
   --  For other non-elementary types, a check is only made if an explicit
   --  size has been given for the type (and the specified size must match).
   --  The parameter Biased is set False if the size specified did not require
   --  the use of biased representation, and True if biased representation
   --  was required to meet the size requirement. Note that Biased is only
   --  set if the type is not currently biased, but biasing it is the only
   --  way to meet the requirement. If the type is currently biased, then
   --  this biased size is used in the initial check, and Biased is False.
   --  If the size is too small, and an error message is given, then both
   --  Esize and RM_Size are reset to the allowed minimum value in T.

   function Rep_Item_Too_Early (T : Entity_Id; N : Node_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Called at the start of processing a representation clause or a
   --  representation pragma. Used to check that the representation item
   --  is not being applied to an incomplete type or to a generic formal
   --  type or a type derived from a generic formal type. Returns False if
   --  no such error occurs. If this error does occur, appropriate error
   --  messages are posted on node N, and True is returned.

   function Rep_Item_Too_Late
     (T     : Entity_Id;
      N     : Node_Id;
      FOnly : Boolean := False) return Boolean;
   --  Called at the start of processing a representation clause or a
   --  representation pragma. Used to check that a representation item
   --  for entity T does not appear too late (according to the rules in
   --  RM 13.1(9) and RM 13.1(10)). N is the associated node, which in
   --  the pragma case is the pragma or representation clause itself, used
   --  for placing error messages if the item is too late.
   --
   --  Fonly is a flag that causes only the freezing rule (para 9) to be
   --  applied, and the tests of para 10 are skipped. This is appropriate
   --  for both subtype related attributes (Alignment and Size) and for
   --  stream attributes, which, although certainly not subtype related
   --  attributes, clearly should not be subject to the para 10 restrictions
   --  (see AI95-00137). Similarly, we also skip the para 10 restrictions for
   --  the Storage_Size case where they also clearly do not apply, and for
   --  Stream_Convert which is in the same category as the stream attributes.
   --
   --  If the rep item is too late, an appropriate message is output and
   --  True is returned, which is a signal that the caller should abandon
   --  processing for the item. If the item is not too late, then False
   --  is returned, and the caller can continue processing the item.
   --
   --  If no error is detected, this call also as a side effect links the
   --  representation item onto the head of the representation item chain
   --  (referenced by the First_Rep_Item field of the entity).
   --
   --  Note: Rep_Item_Too_Late must be called with the underlying type in
   --  the case of a private or incomplete type. The protocol is to first
   --  check for Rep_Item_Too_Early using the initial entity, then take the
   --  underlying type, then call Rep_Item_Too_Late on the result.

   function Same_Representation (Typ1, Typ2 : Entity_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Given two types, where the two types are related by possible derivation,
   --  determines if the two types have the same representation, or different
   --  representations, requiring the special processing for representation
   --  change. A False result is possible only for array, enumeration or
   --  record types.

   procedure Validate_Unchecked_Conversion
     (N        : Node_Id;
      Act_Unit : Entity_Id);
   --  Validate a call to unchecked conversion. N is the node for the actual
   --  instantiation, which is used only for error messages. Act_Unit is the
   --  entity for the instantiation, from which the actual types etc. for this
   --  instantiation can be determined. This procedure makes an entry in a
   --  table and/or generates an N_Validate_Unchecked_Conversion node. The
   --  actual checking is done in Validate_Unchecked_Conversions or in the
   --  back end as required.

   procedure Validate_Unchecked_Conversions;
   --  This routine is called after calling the backend to validate
   --  unchecked conversions for size and alignment appropriateness.
   --  The reason it is called that late is to take advantage of any
   --  back-annotation of size and alignment performed by the backend.

   procedure Validate_Address_Clauses;
   --  This is called after the back end has been called (and thus after the
   --  alignments of objects have been back annotated). It goes through the
   --  table of saved address clauses checking for suspicious alignments and
   --  if necessary issuing warnings.
