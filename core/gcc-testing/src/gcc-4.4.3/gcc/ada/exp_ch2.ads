   --  Given an expression N, determines if the expression is a reference
   --  to a formal (of a subprogram or entry), and if so returns the Id
   --  of the corresponding formal entity, otherwise returns Empty. The
   --  reason that this is in Exp_Ch2 is that it has to deal with the case
   --  where the reference is to an entry formal, and has been expanded
   --  already. Since Exp_Ch2 is in charge of the expansion, it is best
   --  suited to knowing how to detect this case. Also handles the case
   --  of references to renamings of formals.
