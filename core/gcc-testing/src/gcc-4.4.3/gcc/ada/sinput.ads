--  This package contains the input routines used for reading the
--  input source file. The actual I/O routines are in OS_Interface,
--  with this module containing only the system independent processing.

--  General Note: throughout the compiler, we use the term line or source
--  line to refer to a physical line in the source, terminated by the end of
--  physical line sequence.

--  There are two distinct concepts of line terminator in GNAT

--    A logical line terminator is what corresponds to the "end of a line" as
--    described in RM 2.2 (13). Any of the characters FF, LF, CR or VT or any
--    wide character that is a Line or Paragraph Separator acts as an end of
--    logical line in this sense, and it is essentially irrelevant whether one
--    or more appears in sequence (since if sequence of such characters is
--    regarded as separate ends of line, then the intervening logical lines
--    are null in any case).

--    A physical line terminator is a sequence of format effectors that is
--    treated as ending a physical line. Physical lines have no Ada semantic
--    significance, but they are significant for error reporting purposes,
--    since errors are identified by line and column location.

--  In GNAT, a physical line is ended by any of the sequences LF, CR/LF, CR or
--  LF/CR. LF is used in typical Unix systems, CR/LF in DOS systems, and CR
--  alone in System 7. We don't know of any system using LF/CR, but it seems
--  reasonable to include this case for consistency. In addition, we recognize
--  any of these sequences in any of the operating systems, for better
--  behavior in treating foreign files (e.g. a Unix file with LF terminators
--  transferred to a DOS system). Finally, wide character codes in categories
--  Separator, Line and Separator, Paragraph are considered to be physical
--  line terminators.

      --  units, or have other units depend on it, without violating the
      --  license of this unit. Examples are public domain units, and
      --  units defined in the RM).

   --  The above license status is checked when the appropriate check is
   --  activated and one source depends on another, and the licensing state
   --  of both files is known:

   --  The prohibited combinations are:

   --    Restricted file may not depend on GPL file

   --    GPL file may not depend on Restricted file

   --    Modified GPL file may not depend on Restricted file
   --    Modified_GPL file may not depend on GPL file

   --  The reason for the last restriction here is that a client depending
   --  on a modified GPL file must be sure that the license condition is
   --  correct considered transitively.

   --  The licensing status is determined either by the presence of a
   --  specific pragma License, or by scanning the header for a predefined
   --  file, or any file if compiling in -gnatg mode.

   -----------------------
   -- Source File Table --
   -----------------------

   --  The source file table has an entry for each source file read in for
   --  this run of the compiler. This table is (default) initialized when
   --  the compiler is loaded, and simply accumulates entries as compilation
   --  proceeds and various routines in Sinput and its child packages are
   --  called to load required source files.

   --  Virtual entries are also created for generic templates when they are
   --  instantiated, as described in a separate section later on.

   --  In the case where there are multiple main units (e.g. in the case of
   --  the cross-reference tool), this table is not reset between these units,
   --  so that a given source file is only read once if it is used by two
   --  separate main units.

   --  The entries in the table are accessed using a Source_File_Index that
   --  ranges from 1 to Last_Source_File. Each entry has the following fields

   --  Note: fields marked read-only are set by Sinput or one of its child
   --  packages when a source file table entry is created, and cannot be
   --  subsequently modified, or alternatively are set only by very special
   --  circumstances, documented in the comments.

   --  File_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name of the source file (simple name with no directory information)

   --  Full_File_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Full file name (full name with directory info), used for generation
   --    of error messages, etc.

   --  File_Type : Type_Of_File (read-only)
   --    Indicates type of file (source file, configuration pragmas file,
   --    preprocessor definition file, preprocessor input file).

   --  Reference_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name to be used for source file references in error messages where
   --    only the simple name of the file is required. Identical to File_Name
   --    unless pragma Source_Reference is used to change it. Only processing
   --    for the Source_Reference pragma circuit may set this field.

   --  Full_Ref_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name to be used for source file references in error messages where
   --    the full name of the file is required. Identical to Full_File_Name
   --    unless pragma Source_Reference is used to change it. Only processing
   --    for the Source_Reference pragma may set this field.

   --  Debug_Source_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name to be used for source file references in debugging information
   --    where only the simple name of the file is required. Identical to
   --    Reference_Name unless the -gnatD (debug source file) switch is used.
   --    Only processing in Sprint that generates this file is permitted to
   --    set this field.

   --  Full_Debug_Name : File_Name_Type (read-only)
   --    Name to be used for source file references in debugging information
   --    where the full name of the file is required. This is identical to
   --    Full_Ref_Name unless the -gnatD (debug source file) switch is used.
   --    Only processing in Sprint that generates this file is permitted to
   --    set this field.

   --  License : License_Type;
   --    License status of source file

   --  Num_SRef_Pragmas : Nat;
   --    Number of source reference pragmas present in source file

   --  First_Mapped_Line : Logical_Line_Number;
   --    This field stores logical line number of the first line in the
   --    file that is not a Source_Reference pragma. If no source reference
   --    pragmas are used, then the value is set to No_Line_Number.

   --  Source_Text : Source_Buffer_Ptr (read-only)
   --    Text of source file. Note that every source file has a distinct set
   --    of non-overlapping logical bounds, so it is possible to determine
   --    which file is referenced from a given subscript (Source_Ptr) value.

   --  Source_First : Source_Ptr; (read-only)
   --    Subscript of first character in Source_Text. Note that this cannot
   --    be obtained as Source_Text'First, because we use virtual origin
   --    addressing.

   --  Source_Last : Source_Ptr; (read-only)
   --    Subscript of last character in Source_Text. Note that this cannot
   --    be obtained as Source_Text'Last, because we use virtual origin
   --    addressing, so this value is always Source_Ptr'Last.

   --  Time_Stamp : Time_Stamp_Type; (read-only)
   --    Time stamp of the source file

   --  Source_Checksum : Word;
   --    Computed checksum for contents of source file. See separate section
   --    later on in this spec for a description of the checksum algorithm.

   --  Last_Source_Line : Physical_Line_Number;
   --    Physical line number of last source line. While a file is being
   --    read, this refers to the last line scanned. Once a file has been
   --    completely scanned, it is the number of the last line in the file,
   --    and hence also gives the number of source lines in the file.

   --  Keyword_Casing : Casing_Type;
   --    Casing style used in file for keyword casing. This is initialized
   --    to Unknown, and then set from the first occurrence of a keyword.
   --    This value is used only for formatting of error messages.

   --  Identifier_Casing : Casing_Type;
   --    Casing style used in file for identifier casing. This is initialized
   --    to Unknown, and then set from an identifier in the program as soon as
   --    one is found whose casing is sufficiently clear to make a decision.
   --    This value is used for formatting of error messages, and also is used
   --    in the detection of keywords misused as identifiers.

   --  Instantiation : Source_Ptr;
   --    Source file location of the instantiation if this source file entry
   --    represents a generic instantiation. Set to No_Location for the case
   --    of a normal non-instantiation entry. See section below for details.
   --    This field is read-only for clients.

   --  Inlined_Body : Boolean;
   --    This can only be set True if Instantiation has a value other than
   --    No_Location. If true it indicates that the instantiation is actually
   --    an instance of an inlined body.

   --  Template : Source_File_Index; (read-only)
   --    Source file index of the source file containing the template if this
   --    is a generic instantiation. Set to No_Source_File for the normal case
   --    of a non-instantiation entry. See Sinput-L for details.

   --  Unit : Unit_Number_Type;
   --    Identifies the unit contained in this source file. Set by
   --    Initialize_Scanner, must not be subsequently altered.

   --  The source file table is accessed by clients using the following
   --  subprogram interface:

   subtype SFI is Source_File_Index;

   System_Source_File_Index : SFI;
   --  The file system.ads is always read by the compiler to determine the
   --  settings of the target parameters in the private part of System. This
   --  variable records the source file index of system.ads. Typically this
   --  will be 1 since system.ads is read first.

   -----------------------------
   -- Source_File_Index_Table --
   -----------------------------

   --  The Get_Source_File_Index function is called very frequently. Earlier
   --  versions cached a single entry, but then reverted to a serial search,
   --  and this proved to be a significant source of inefficiency. To get
   --  around this, we use the following directly indexed array. The space
   --  of possible input values is a value of type Source_Ptr which is simply
   --  an Int value. The values in this space are allocated sequentially as
   --  new units are loaded.

   --  The following table has an entry for each 4K range of possible
   --  Source_Ptr values. The value in the table is the lowest value
   --  Source_File_Index whose Source_Ptr range contains value in the
   --  range.

   --  For example, the entry with index 4 in this table represents Source_Ptr
   --  values in the range 4*4096 .. 5*4096-1. The Source_File_Index value
   --  stored would be the lowest numbered source file with at least one byte
   --  in this range.

   --  The algorithm used in Get_Source_File_Index is simply to access this
   --  table and then do a serial search starting at the given position. This
   --  will almost always terminate with one or two checks.

   --  Note that this array is pretty large, but in most operating systems
   --  it will not be allocated in physical memory unless it is actually used.

   Chunk_Power : constant := 12;
   Chunk_Size  : constant := 2 ** Chunk_Power;
   --  Change comments above if value changed. Note that Chunk_Size must
   --  be a power of 2 (to allow for efficient access to the table).

   Source_File_Index_Table :
     array (Int range 0 .. Int'Last / Chunk_Size) of Source_File_Index;

   procedure Set_Source_File_Index_Table (Xnew : Source_File_Index);
   --  Sets entries in the Source_File_Index_Table for the newly created
   --  Source_File table entry whose index is Xnew. The Source_First and
   --  Source_Last fields of this entry must be set before the call.

   -----------------------
   -- Checksum Handling --
   -----------------------

   --  As a source file is scanned, a checksum is computed by taking all the
   --  non-blank characters in the file, excluding comment characters, the
   --  minus-minus sequence starting a comment, and all control characters
   --  except ESC.

   --  The checksum algorithm used is the standard CRC-32 algorithm, as
   --  implemented by System.CRC32, except that we do not bother with the
   --  final XOR with all 1 bits.

   --  This algorithm ensures that the checksum includes all semantically
   --  significant aspects of the program represented by the source file,
   --  but is insensitive to layout, presence or contents of comments, wide
   --  character representation method, or casing conventions outside strings.

   --  Scans.Checksum is initialized appropriately at the start of scanning
   --  a file, and copied into the Source_Checksum field of the file table
   --  entry when the end of file is encountered.

   -------------------------------------
   -- Handling Generic Instantiations --
   -------------------------------------

   --  As described in Sem_Ch12, a generic instantiation involves making a
   --  copy of the tree of the generic template. The source locations in
   --  this tree directly reference the source of the template. However it
   --  is also possible to find the location of the instantiation.

   --  This is achieved as follows. When an instantiation occurs, a new entry
   --  is made in the source file table. This entry points to the same source
   --  text, i.e. the file that contains the instantiation, but has a distinct
   --  set of Source_Ptr index values. The separate range of Sloc values avoids
   --  confusion, and means that the Sloc values can still be used to uniquely
   --  identify the source file table entry. It is possible for both entries
   --  to point to the same text, because of the virtual origin pointers used
   --  in the source table.

   --  The Instantiation field of this source file index entry, usually set
   --  to No_Source_File, instead contains the Sloc of the instantiation. In
   --  the case of nested instantiations, this Sloc may itself refer to an
   --  instantiation, so the complete chain can be traced.

   --  Two routines are used to build these special entries in the source
   --  file table. Create_Instantiation_Source is first called to build
   --  the virtual source table entry for the instantiation, and then the
   --  Sloc values in the copy are adjusted using Adjust_Instantiation_Sloc.
   --  See child unit Sinput.L for details on these two routines.
