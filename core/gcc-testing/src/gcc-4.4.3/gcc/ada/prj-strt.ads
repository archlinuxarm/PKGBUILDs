   --  a left parenthesis in a string type declaration such as:
   --    type Toto is ("string_1", "string_2", "string_3");
   --  On exit, the current token is the right parenthesis.
   --  The parameter First_String is a node that contained the first
   --  literal string of the string type, linked with the following
   --  literal strings.
   --
   --  Report an error if
   --    - a literal string is not found at the beginning of the list
   --      or after a comma

   --  In particular, in the case of nested case constructions,
   --  the case labels of the enclosing case construction are restored.
   --  When When_Others is False and we are not in quiet output, a warning
