--  Processing for expanding intrinsic subprogram calls

with Types; use Types;

package Exp_Intr is

   procedure Expand_Intrinsic_Call (N : Node_Id; E : Entity_Id);
   --  N is either a function call node, or a procedure call statement node
   --  where the corresponding subprogram is intrinsic (i.e. was the subject
   --  of a Import or Interface pragma specifying the subprogram as intrinsic.
   --  The effect is to replace the call with appropriate specialized nodes.
   --  The second argument is the entity for the subprogram spec.
