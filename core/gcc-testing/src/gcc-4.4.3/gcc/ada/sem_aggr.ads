--  This package contains the resolution code for aggregates. It is logically
--  part of Sem_Res, but is split off since the aggregate code is so complex.

with Types; use Types;

package Sem_Aggr is

   procedure Resolve_Aggregate           (N : Node_Id; Typ : Entity_Id);
   procedure Resolve_Extension_Aggregate (N : Node_Id; Typ : Entity_Id);
