   -- Data Structures for Overload Resolution --
   ---------------------------------------------

   --  To determine the unique meaning of an identifier, overload resolution
   --  may have to be performed if the visibility rules alone identify more
   --  than one possible entity as the denotation of a given identifier. When
   --  the visibility rules find such a potential ambiguity, the set of
   --  possible interpretations must be attached to the identifier, and
   --  overload resolution must be performed over the innermost enclosing
   --  complete context. At the end of the resolution, either a single
   --  interpretation is found for all identifiers in the context, or else a
   --  type error (invalid type or ambiguous reference) must be signalled.

   --  The set of interpretations of a given name is stored in a data structure
   --  that is separate from the syntax tree, because it corresponds to
   --  transient information. The interpretations themselves are stored in
   --  table All_Interp. A mapping from tree nodes to sets of interpretations
   --  called Interp_Map, is maintained by the overload resolution routines.
   --  Both these structures are initialized at the beginning of every complete
   --  context.

   --  Corresponding to the set of interpretations for a given overloadable
   --  identifier, there is a set of possible types corresponding to the types
   --  that the overloaded call may return. We keep a 1-to-1 correspondence
   --  between interpretations and types: for user-defined subprograms the
   --  type is the declared return type. For operators, the type is determined
   --  by the type of the arguments. If the arguments themselves are
   --  overloaded, we enter the operator name in the names table for each
   --  possible result type. In most cases, arguments are not overloaded and
   --  only one interpretation is present anyway.

   type Interp is record
      Nam         : Entity_Id;
      Typ         : Entity_Id;
      Abstract_Op : Entity_Id := Empty;
   end record;

   --  Entity Abstract_Op is set to the abstract operation which potentially
   --  disables the interpretation in Ada 2005 mode.

   No_Interp : constant Interp := (Empty, Empty, Empty);

   subtype Interp_Index is Int;

   -- Error Reporting --
   ---------------------

   --  A common error is the use of an operator in infix notation on arguments
   --  of a type that is not directly visible. Rather than diagnosing a type
   --  mismatch, it is better to indicate that the type can be made use-visible
   --  with the appropriate use clause. The global variable Candidate_Type is
   --  set in Add_One_Interp whenever an interpretation might be legal for an
   --  operator if the type were directly visible. This variable is used in
   --  sem_ch4 when no legal interpretation is found.

   procedure Init_Interp_Tables;

   procedure Collect_Interps (N : Node_Id);
   --  Invoked when the name N has more than one visible interpretation.
   --  This is the high level routine which accumulates the possible
   --  interpretations of the node. The first meaning and type of N have
   --  already been stored in N. If the name is an expanded name, the homonyms
   --  are only those that belong to the same scope.

   function Is_Invisible_Operator
     (N    : Node_Id;
      T    : Entity_Id)
      return Boolean;
   --  Check whether a predefined operation with universal operands appears

   procedure List_Interps (Nam : Node_Id; Err : Node_Id);

   --  Add (E, T) to the list of interpretations of the node being resolved.
   --  For calls and operators, i.e. for nodes that have a name field,
   --  E is an overloadable entity, and T is its type. For constructs such
   --  as indexed expressions, the caller sets E equal to T, because the
   --  overloading comes from other fields, and the node itself has no name
   --  to resolve. Hidden denotes whether an interpretation has been disabled
   --  by an abstract operator. Add_One_Interp includes semantic processing to
   --  deal with adding entries that hide one another etc.

   --  For operators, the legality of the operation depends on the visibility
   --  of T and its scope. If the operator is an equality or comparison, T is
   --  always Boolean, and we use Opnd_Type, which is a candidate type for one
   --  of the operands of N, to check visibility.

   --  to a subsequent call to Get_Next_Interp, which yields the interpretation
   --  following the removed one.

   procedure Save_Interps (Old_N : Node_Id; New_N : Node_Id);
