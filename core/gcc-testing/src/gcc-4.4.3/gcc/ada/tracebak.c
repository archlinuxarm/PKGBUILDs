/* The stack layout is specified by the target ABI. The "generic" scheme is
   based on the following assumption:

     The stack layout from some frame pointer is such that the information
     required to compute the backtrace is available at static offsets.

   For a given frame, the information we are interested in is the saved return
   address (somewhere after the call instruction in the caller) and a pointer
   to the caller's frame. The former is the base of the call chain information
   we store in the tracebacks array. The latter allows us to loop over the
   successive frames in the chain.

   To initiate the process, we retrieve an initial frame address using the
   appropriate GCC builtin (__builtin_frame_address).

   This scheme is unfortunately not applicable on every target because the
   stack layout is not necessarily regular (static) enough. On targets where
   this scheme applies, the implementation relies on the following items:

   o struct layout, describing the expected stack data layout relevant to the
     information we are interested in,

   o FRAME_OFFSET, the offset, from a given frame address or frame pointer
     value, at which this layout will be found,

   o FRAME_LEVEL, controls how many frames up we get at to start with,
     from the initial frame pointer we compute by way of the GCC builtin,

     0 is most often the appropriate value. 1 may be necessary on targets
     where return addresses are saved by a function in it's caller's frame
     (e.g. PPC).

   o PC_ADJUST, to account for the difference between a call point (address
     of a call instruction), which is what we want in the output array, and
     the associated return address, which is what we retrieve from the stack.

   o STOP_FRAME, to decide whether we reached the top of the call chain, and
     thus if the process shall stop.

		         +----------------+

   o BASE_SKIP,

   Since we inherently deal with return addresses, there is an implicit shift
   by at least one for the initial point we are able to observe in the chain.

   On some targets (e.g. sparc-solaris), the first return address we can
   easily get without special code is even our caller's return address, so
   there is a initial shift of two.

   BASE_SKIP represents this initial shift, which is the minimal "skip_frames"
   value we support. We could add special code for the skip_frames < BASE_SKIP
   cases. This is not done currently because there is virtually no situation
   in which this would be useful.

   Finally, to account for some ABI specificities, a target may (but does
   not have to) define:

   o FORCE_CALL, to force a call to a dummy function at the very beginning
     of the computation. See the PPC AIX target for an example where this
     is useful.

   o FETCH_UP_FRAME, to force an invocation of __builtin_frame_address with a
     positive argument right after a possibly forced call even if FRAME_LEVEL
     is 0. See the SPARC Solaris case for an example where this is useful.
