--  Spelling checker

--  This package provides a utility routine for checking for bad spellings
--  for the case of String arguments.

pragma Warnings (Off);
pragma Compiler_Unit;
pragma Warnings (On);

package GNAT.Spelling_Checker is
   pragma Pure;

   function Is_Bad_Spelling_Of
     (Found  : String;
      Expect : String) return Boolean;
   --  Determines if the string Found is a plausible misspelling of the string
   --  Expect. Returns True for an exact match or a probably misspelling, False
   --  if no near match is detected. This routine is case sensitive, so the
   --  caller should fold both strings to get a case insensitive match.
   --
   --  Note: the spec of this routine is deliberately rather vague. It is used
   --  by GNAT itself to detect misspelled keywords and identifiers, and is
   --  heuristically adjusted to be appropriate to this usage. It will work
   --  well in any similar case of named entities.
