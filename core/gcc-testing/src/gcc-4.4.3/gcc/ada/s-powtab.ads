--  This package provides a powers of ten table used for real conversions

   pragma Pure;

   --  The number of entries in this table is chosen to include powers of ten
   --  that are exactly representable with long_long_float. Assuming that on
   --  all targets we have 53 bits of mantissa for the type, the upper bound is
   --  given by 53/(log 5). If the scaling factor for a string is greater than
   --  Maxpow, it can be obtained by several multiplications, which is less
   --  efficient than with a bigger table, but avoids anomalies at end points.
