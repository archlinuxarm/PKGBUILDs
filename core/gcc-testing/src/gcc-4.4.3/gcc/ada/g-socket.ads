--  This package provides an interface to the sockets communication facility
--  provided on many operating systems. This is implemented on the following
--  platforms:

--     All native ports, with restrictions as follows

--       Multicast is available only on systems which provide support for this
--       feature, so it is not available if Multicast is not supported, or not
--       installed.

--       The VMS implementation was implemented using the DECC RTL Socket API,
--       and is thus subject to limitations in the implementation of this API.

--     VxWorks cross ports fully implement this package

--     This package is not yet implemented on LynxOS or other cross ports

package GNAT.Sockets is

   --  Sockets are designed to provide a consistent communication facility
   --  between applications. This package provides an Ada binding to the
   --  the de-facto standard BSD sockets API. The documentation below covers
   --  only the specific binding provided by this package. It assumes that
   --  the reader is already familiar with general network programming and
   --  sockets usage. A useful reference on this matter is W. Richard Stevens'
   --  "UNIX Network Programming: The Sockets Networking API"
   --  (ISBN: 0131411551).

   --  GNAT.Sockets has been designed with several ideas in mind

   --  This is a system independent interface. Therefore, we try as much as
   --  possible to mask system incompatibilities. Some functionalities are not
   --  available because there are not fully supported on some systems.

   --  This is a thick binding. For instance, a major effort has been done to
   --  avoid using memory addresses or untyped ints. We preferred to define
   --  streams and enumeration types. Errors are not returned as returned
   --  values but as exceptions.

   --  This package provides a POSIX-compliant interface (between two
   --  different implementations of the same routine, we adopt the one closest
   --  to the POSIX specification). For instance, using select(), the
   --  notification of an asynchronous connect failure is delivered in the
   --  write socket set (POSIX) instead of the exception socket set (NT).

   --  The example below demonstrates various features of GNAT.Sockets:

   --  with GNAT.Sockets; use GNAT.Sockets;

   --  with Ada.Text_IO;
   --  with Ada.Exceptions; use Ada.Exceptions;

   --        --  The first step is to create a socket. Once created, this

   --        --  server (Pong here) needs to bind an address explicitly. Most
   --        --  of the time clients can skip this step because the socket
