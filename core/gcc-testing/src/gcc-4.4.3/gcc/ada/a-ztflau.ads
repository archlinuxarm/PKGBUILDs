--  This package contains the routines for Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Float_IO that
--  are shared among separate instantiations of this package. The routines
--  in this package are identical semantically to those in Float_IO itself,
--  except that generic parameter Num has been replaced by Long_Long_Float,
--  and the default parameters have been removed because they are supplied
--  explicitly by the calls from within the generic template. Also used by
--  Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Fixed_IO, and by Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Decimal_IO.

private package Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO.Float_Aux is

   procedure Load_Real
     (File : File_Type;
      Buf  : out String;
      Ptr  : in out Natural);
   --  This is an auxiliary routine that is used to load a possibly signed
   --  real literal value from the input file into Buf, starting at Ptr + 1.

   procedure Get
     (File  : File_Type;
      Item  : out Long_Long_Float;
      Width : Field);

   procedure Gets
     (From : String;
      Item : out Long_Long_Float;
      Last : out Positive);

      Item : Long_Long_Float;
      Fore : Field;
