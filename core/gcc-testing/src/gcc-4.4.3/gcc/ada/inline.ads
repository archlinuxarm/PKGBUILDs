--  This module handles two kinds of inlining activity:

--  a) Instantiation of generic bodies. This is done unconditionally, after
--  analysis and expansion of the main unit.

--  b) Compilation of unit bodies that contain the bodies of inlined sub-
--  programs. This is done only if inlining is enabled (-gnatn). Full inlining
--  requires that a) an b) be mutually recursive, because each step may
--  generate another generic expansion and further inlined calls. For now each
--  of them uses a workpile algorithm, but they are called independently from
--  Frontend, and thus are not mutually recursive.

   --  analysis and expansion step.
