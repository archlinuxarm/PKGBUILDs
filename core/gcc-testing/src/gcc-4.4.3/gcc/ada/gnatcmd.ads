--  This program provides a simple command interface for using GNAT and its
--  associated utilities. The format of switches accepted is intended to
--  be more familiar in style for VMS and DOS users than the standard Unix
--  style switches that are accepted directly.

--    The program is typically called GNAT when it is installed and
--    the two possible styles of use are:

--  To call gcc:

--    GNAT filename switches

--  To call the tool gnatxxx

--    GNAT xxx filename switches

--  where xxx is the command name (e.g. MAKE for gnatmake). This command name
--  can be abbreviated by giving a prefix (e.g. GNAT MAK) as long as it
--  remains unique.

--  In both cases, filename is in the format appropriate to the operating
--  system in use. The individual commands give more details. In some cases
--  a unit name may be given in place of a file name.

--  The switches start with a slash. Switch names can also be abbreviated
--  where no ambiguity arises. The switches associated with each command
--  are specified by the tables that can be found in the body.

--  Although by convention we use upper case for command names and switches
--  in the documentation, all command and switch names are case insensitive
--  and may be given in upper case or lower case or a mixture.
