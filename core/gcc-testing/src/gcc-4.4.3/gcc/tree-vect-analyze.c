/* Return the smallest scalar part of STMT.
   This is used to determine the vectype of the stmt. We generally set the 
   vectype according to the type of the result (lhs). For stmts whose 
   result-type is different than the type of the arguments (e.g., demotion,
   promotion), vectype will be reset appropriately (later).  Note that we have 
   to visit the smallest datatype in this function, because that determines the
   VF. If the smallest datatype in the loop is present only as the rhs of a 
   promotion operation - we'd miss it.
   Such a case, where a variable of this datatype does not appear in the lhs
   anywhere in the loop, can only occur if it's an invariant: e.g.:
   'int_x = (int) short_inv', which we'd expect to have been optimized away by 
   invariant motion. However, we cannot rely on invariant motion to always take
   invariants out of the loop, and so in the case of promotion we also have to
   check the rhs. 
   LHS_SIZE_UNIT and RHS_SIZE_UNIT contain the sizes of the corresponding
   types.  */

/* Function vect_determine_vectorization_factor

   Determine the vectorization factor (VF). VF is the number of data elements
   that are operated upon in parallel in a single iteration of the vectorized
   loop. For example, when vectorizing a loop that operates on 4byte elements,
   on a target with vector size (VS) 16byte, the VF is set to 4, since 4
   elements can fit in a single vector register.

   We currently support vectorization of loops in which all types operated upon
   are of the same size. Therefore this function currently sets VF according to
   the size of the types operated upon, and fails if there are multiple sizes
   in the loop.

   VF is also the factor by which the loop iterations are strip-mined, e.g.:
   original loop:
        for (i=0; i<N; i++){
          a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
        }

   vectorized loop:
        for (i=0; i<N; i+=VF){
          a[i:VF] = b[i:VF] + c[i:VF];
        }

   This pass will use loop versioning and loop peeling in order to enhance
   the alignment of data references in the loop.

   FOR NOW: we assume that whatever versioning/peeling takes place, only the
   original loop is to be vectorized; Any other loops that are created by
   the transformations performed in this pass - are not supposed to be
   vectorized. This restriction will be relaxed.

   This pass will require a cost model to guide it whether to apply peeling
   or versioning or a combination of the two. For example, the scheme that
   intel uses when given a loop with several memory accesses, is as follows:
   choose one memory access ('p') which alignment you want to force by doing
   peeling. Then, either (1) generate a loop in which 'p' is aligned and all
   other accesses are not necessarily aligned, or (2) use loop versioning to
   generate one loop in which all accesses are aligned, and another loop in
   which only 'p' is necessarily aligned.

   ("Automatic Intra-Register Vectorization for the Intel Architecture",
   Aart J.C. Bik, Milind Girkar, Paul M. Grey and Ximmin Tian, International
   Journal of Parallel Programming, Vol. 30, No. 2, April 2002.)

   Devising a cost model is the most critical aspect of this work. It will
   guide us on which access to peel for, whether to use loop versioning, how
   many versions to create, etc. The cost model will probably consist of
   generic considerations as well as target specific considerations (on
   powerpc for example, misaligned stores are more painful than misaligned
   loads).

   Here are the general steps involved in alignment enhancements:

     -- original loop, before alignment analysis:
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = unknown
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
	}

     -- After vect_compute_data_refs_alignment:
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
	}

     -- Possibility 1: we do loop versioning:
     if (p is aligned) {
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){	# loop 1A
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = 0
	}
     }
     else {
	for (i=0; i<N; i++){	# loop 1B
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 3
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unaligned
	}
     }

     -- Possibility 2: we do loop peeling:
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){	# (scalar loop, not to be vectorized).
	x = q[i];
	p[i] = y;
     }
     for (i = 3; i < N; i++){	# loop 2A
	x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unknown
     }

     -- Possibility 3: combination of loop peeling and versioning:
     for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){	# (scalar loop, not to be vectorized).
	x = q[i];
	p[i] = y;
     }
     if (p is aligned) {
	for (i = 3; i<N; i++){	# loop 3A
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = 0
	}
     }
     else {
	for (i = 3; i<N; i++){	# loop 3B
	  x = q[i];			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(q) = 0
	  p[i] = y;			# DR_MISALIGNMENT(p) = unaligned
	}
     }

     These loops are later passed to loop_transform to be vectorized. The
     vectorizer will use the alignment information to guide the transformation
     (whether to generate regular loads/stores, or with special handling for
     misalignment).  */

   Inputs:
   - a USE in STMT in a loop represented by LOOP_VINFO
   - LIVE_P, RELEVANT - enum values to be set in the STMT_VINFO of the stmt 
     that defined USE. This is done by calling mark_relevant and passing it

   Outputs:
   Generally, LIVE_P and RELEVANT are used to define the liveness and
   relevance info of the DEF_STMT of this USE:
       STMT_VINFO_LIVE_P (DEF_STMT_info) <-- live_p
       STMT_VINFO_RELEVANT (DEF_STMT_info) <-- relevant
   Exceptions:
   - case 1: If USE is used only for address computations (e.g. array indexing),
   which does not need to be directly vectorized, then the liveness/relevance 
   of the respective DEF_STMT is left unchanged.
   - case 2: If STMT is a reduction phi and DEF_STMT is a reduction stmt, we 
   skip DEF_STMT cause it had already been processed.  
   - case 3: If DEF_STMT and STMT are in different nests, then  "relevant" will
