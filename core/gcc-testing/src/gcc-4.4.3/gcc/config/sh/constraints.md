;; Cxx: Constants other than only CONST_INT
;;  Css: signed 16-bit constant, literal or symbolic
;;  Csu: unsigned 16-bit constant, literal or symbolic
;;  Csy: label or symbol
;;  Cpg: non-explicit constants that can be directly loaded into a general
;;       purpose register in PIC code.  like 's' except we don't allow
;;       PIC_ADDR_P
;; IJKLMNOP: CONT_INT constants
;;  Ixx: signed xx bit
;;  J16: 0xffffffff00000000 | 0x00000000ffffffff
