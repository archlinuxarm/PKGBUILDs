  OP0 and OP1 are of the same pointer types and stand for 
  D.1606_7 and a_p.2_8 or vise versa.

  This function checks that:

  1. one of OP0 and OP1 (D.1606_7) has passed only one cast from 
  non-pointer type (D.1606_7 = (struct str_t *) D.1605_6;).

  2. one of OP0 and OP1 which has passed the cast from 
  non-pointer type (D.1606_7), is actually generated by multiplication of 
  index by size of type to which both OP0 and OP1 point to
  (in this case D.1605_6 = i.1_5 * 16; ).

  3. an address of def of the var to which was made cast (D.1605_6) 
  was not taken.(How can it happen?)

  The following items are checked implicitly by the end of algorithm:

  4. one of OP0 and OP1 (a_p.2_8) have never been cast 
  (because if it was cast to pointer type, its type, that is also 
  the type of OP0 and OP1, will be marked as escaped during 
  analysis of casting stmt (when check_cast() is called 
  from scan_for_refs for this stmt)).   

  5. defs of OP0 and OP1 are not passed into externally visible function
  (because if they are passed then their type, that is also the type of OP0
  and OP1, will be marked and escaped during check_call function called from 
  scan_for_refs with call stmt).

  In total, 1-5 guaranty that it's an access to array by pointer and index.
