+Introduction
+----------------------------------------
+
+aufs [ei ju: ef es] | [a u f s]
+1. abbrev. for "advanced multi-layered unification filesystem".
+2. abbrev. for "another unionfs".
+3. abbrev. for "auf das" in German which means "on the" in English.
+   Ex. "Butter aufs Brot"(G) means "butter onto bread"(E).
+   But "Filesystem aufs Filesystem" is hard to understand.
+
+AUFS is a filesystem with features:
+- multi layered stackable unification filesystem, the member directory
+  is called as a branch.
+- branch permission and attribute, 'readonly', 'real-readonly',
+  'readwrite', 'whiteout-able', 'link-able whiteout' and their
+  combination.
+- internal "file copy-on-write".
+- logical deletion, whiteout.
+- dynamic branch manipulation, adding, deleting and changing permission.
+- allow bypassing aufs, user's direct branch access.
+- external inode number translation table and bitmap which maintains the
+  persistent aufs inode number.
+- seekable directory, including NFS readdir.
+- file mapping, mmap and sharing pages.
+- pseudo-link, hardlink over branches.
+- loopback mounted filesystem as a branch.
+- several policies to select one among multiple writable branches.
+- revert a single systemcall when an error occurs in aufs.
+- and more...
+
+
+Multi Layered Stackable Unification Filesystem
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Most people already knows what it is.
+It is a filesystem which unifies several directories and provides a
+merged single directory. When users access a file, the access will be
+passed/re-directed/converted (sorry, I am not sure which English word is
+correct) to the real file on the member filesystem. The member
+filesystem is called 'lower filesystem' or 'branch' and has a mode
+'readonly' and 'readwrite.' And the deletion for a file on the lower
+readonly branch is handled by creating 'whiteout' on the upper writable
+branch.
+
+On LKML, there have been discussions about UnionMount (Jan Blunck,
+Bharata B Rao and Valerie Aurora) and Unionfs (Erez Zadok). They took
+different approaches to implement the merged-view.
+The former tries putting it into VFS, and the latter implements as a
+separate filesystem.
+(If I misunderstand about these implementations, please let me know and
+I shall correct it. Because it is a long time ago when I read their
+source files last time).
+
+UnionMount's approach will be able to small, but may be hard to share
+branches between several UnionMount since the whiteout in it is
+implemented in the inode on branch filesystem and always
+shared. According to Bharata's post, readdir does not seems to be
+finished yet.
+There are several missing features known in this implementations such as
+- for users, the inode number may change silently. eg. copy-up.
+- link(2) may break by copy-up.
+- read(2) may get an obsoleted filedata (fstat(2) too).
+- fcntl(F_SETLK) may be broken by copy-up.
+- unnecessary copy-up may happen, for example mmap(MAP_PRIVATE) after
+  open(O_RDWR).
+
+Unionfs has a longer history. When I started implementing a stacking filesystem
+(Aug 2005), it already existed. It has virtual super_block, inode,
+dentry and file objects and they have an array pointing lower same kind
+objects. After contributing many patches for Unionfs, I re-started my
+project AUFS (Jun 2006).
+
+In AUFS, the structure of filesystem resembles to Unionfs, but I
+implemented my own ideas, approaches and enhancements and it became
+totally different one.
+
+Comparing DM snapshot and fs based implementation
+- the number of bytes to be copied between devices is much smaller.
+- the type of filesystem must be one and only.
+- the fs must be writable, no readonly fs, even for the lower original
+  device. so the compression fs will not be usable. but if we use
+  loopback mount, we may address this issue.
+  for instance,
+	mount /cdrom/squashfs.img /sq
+	losetup /sq/ext2.img
+	losetup /somewhere/cow
+	dmsetup "snapshot /dev/loop0 /dev/loop1 ..."
+- it will be difficult (or needs more operations) to extract the
+  difference between the original device and COW.
+- DM snapshot-merge may help a lot when users try merging. in the
+  fs-layer union, users will use rsync(1).
+
+
+Several characters/aspects of aufs
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Aufs has several characters or aspects.
+1. a filesystem, callee of VFS helper
+2. sub-VFS, caller of VFS helper for branches
+3. a virtual filesystem which maintains persistent inode number
+4. reader/writer of files on branches such like an application
+
+1. Callee of VFS Helper
+As an ordinary linux filesystem, aufs is a callee of VFS. For instance,
+unlink(2) from an application reaches sys_unlink() kernel function and
+then vfs_unlink() is called. vfs_unlink() is one of VFS helper and it
+calls filesystem specific unlink operation. Actually aufs implements the
+unlink operation but it behaves like a redirector.
+
+2. Caller of VFS Helper for Branches
+aufs_unlink() passes the unlink request to the branch filesystem as if
+it were called from VFS. So the called unlink operation of the branch
+filesystem acts as usual. As a caller of VFS helper, aufs should handle
+every necessary pre/post operation for the branch filesystem.
+- acquire the lock for the parent dir on a branch
+- lookup in a branch
+- revalidate dentry on a branch
+- mnt_want_write() for a branch
+- vfs_unlink() for a branch
+- mnt_drop_write() for a branch
+- release the lock on a branch
+
+3. Persistent Inode Number
+One of the most important issue for a filesystem is to maintain inode
+numbers. This is particularly important to support exporting a
+filesystem via NFS. Aufs is a virtual filesystem which doesn't have a
+backend block device for its own. But some storage is necessary to
+maintain inode number. It may be a large space and may not suit to keep
+in memory. Aufs rents some space from its first writable branch
+filesystem (by default) and creates file(s) on it. These files are
+created by aufs internally and removed soon (currently) keeping opened.
+Note: Because these files are removed, they are totally gone after
+      unmounting aufs. It means the inode numbers are not persistent
+      across unmount or reboot. I have a plan to make them really
+      persistent which will be important for aufs on NFS server.
+
+4. Read/Write Files Internally (copy-on-write)
+Because a branch can be readonly, when you write a file on it, aufs will
+"copy-up" it to the upper writable branch internally. And then write the
+originally requested thing to the file. Generally kernel doesn't
+open/read/write file actively. In aufs, even a single write may cause a
+internal "file copy". This behaviour is very similar to cp(1) command.
+
+Some people may think it is better to pass such work to user space
+helper, instead of doing in kernel space. Actually I am still thinking
+about it. But currently I have implemented it in kernel space.

+
+Basic Aufs Internal Structure
+
+Superblock/Inode/Dentry/File Objects
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+As like an ordinary filesystem, aufs has its own
+superblock/inode/dentry/file objects. All these objects have a
+dynamically allocated array and store the same kind of pointers to the
+lower filesystem, branch.
+For example, when you build a union with one readwrite branch and one
+readonly, mounted /au, /rw and /ro respectively.
+- /au = /rw + /ro
+- /ro/fileA exists but /rw/fileA
+
+Aufs lookup operation finds /ro/fileA and gets dentry for that. These
+pointers are stored in a aufs dentry. The array in aufs dentry will be,
+- [0] = NULL
+- [1] = /ro/fileA
+
+This style of an array is essentially same to the aufs
+superblock/inode/dentry/file objects.
+
+Because aufs supports manipulating branches, ie. add/delete/change
+dynamically, these objects has its own generation. When branches are
+changed, the generation in aufs superblock is incremented. And a
+generation in other object are compared when it is accessed.
+When a generation in other objects are obsoleted, aufs refreshes the
+internal array.
+
+
+Superblock
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Additionally aufs superblock has some data for policies to select one
+among multiple writable branches, XIB files, pseudo-links and kobject.
+See below in detail.
+About the policies which supports copy-down a directory, see policy.txt
+too.
+
+
+Branch and XINO(External Inode Number Translation Table)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Every branch has its own xino (external inode number translation table)
+file. The xino file is created and unlinked by aufs internally. When two
+members of a union exist on the same filesystem, they share the single
+xino file.
+The struct of a xino file is simple, just a sequence of aufs inode
+numbers which is indexed by the lower inode number.
+In the above sample, assume the inode number of /ro/fileA is i111 and
+aufs assigns the inode number i999 for fileA. Then aufs writes 999 as
+4(8) bytes at 111 * 4(8) bytes offset in the xino file.
+
+When the inode numbers are not contiguous, the xino file will be sparse
+which has a hole in it and doesn't consume as much disk space as it
+might appear. If your branch filesystem consumes disk space for such
+holes, then you should specify 'xino=' option at mounting aufs.
+
+Also a writable branch has three kinds of "whiteout bases". All these
+are existed when the branch is joined to aufs and the names are
+whiteout-ed doubly, so that users will never see their names in aufs
+hierarchy.
+1. a regular file which will be linked to all whiteouts.
+2. a directory to store a pseudo-link.
+3. a directory to store an "orphan-ed" file temporary.
+
+1. Whiteout Base
+   When you remove a file on a readonly branch, aufs handles it as a
+   logical deletion and creates a whiteout on the upper writable branch
+   as a hardlink of this file in order not to consume inode on the
+   writable branch.
+2. Pseudo-link Dir
+   See below, Pseudo-link.
+3. Step-Parent Dir
+   When "fileC" exists on the lower readonly branch only and it is
+   opened and removed with its parent dir, and then user writes
+   something into it, then aufs copies-up fileC to this
+   directory. Because there is no other dir to store fileC. After
+   creating a file under this dir, the file is unlinked.
+
+Because aufs supports manipulating branches, ie. add/delete/change
+dynamically, a branch has its own id. When the branch order changes, aufs
+finds the new index by searching the branch id.
+
+
+Pseudo-link
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Assume "fileA" exists on the lower readonly branch only and it is
+hardlinked to "fileB" on the branch. When you write something to fileA,
+aufs copies-up it to the upper writable branch. Additionally aufs
+creates a hardlink under the Pseudo-link Directory of the writable
+branch. The inode of a pseudo-link is kept in aufs super_block as a
+simple list. If fileB is read after unlinking fileA, aufs returns
+filedata from the pseudo-link instead of the lower readonly
+branch. Because the pseudo-link is based upon the inode, to keep the
+inode number by xino (see above) is important.
+
+All the hardlinks under the Pseudo-link Directory of the writable branch
+should be restored in a proper location later. Aufs provides a utility
+to do this. The userspace helpers executed at remounting and unmounting
+aufs by default.
+During this utility is running, it puts aufs into the pseudo-link
+maintenance mode. In this mode, only the process which began the
+maintenance mode (and its child processes) is allowed to operate in
+aufs. Some other processes which are not related to the pseudo-link will
+be allowed to run too, but the rest have to return an error or wait
+until the maintenance mode ends. If a process already acquires an inode
+mutex (in VFS), it has to return an error.
+
+
+XIB(external inode number bitmap)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Addition to the xino file per a branch, aufs has an external inode number
+bitmap in a superblock object. It is also a file such like a xino file.
+It is a simple bitmap to mark whether the aufs inode number is in-use or
+not.
+To reduce the file I/O, aufs prepares a single memory page to cache xib.
+
+Aufs implements a feature to truncate/refresh both of xino and xib to
+reduce the number of consumed disk blocks for these files.
+
+
+Virtual or Vertical Dir, and Readdir in Userspace
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+In order to support multiple layers (branches), aufs readdir operation
+constructs a virtual dir block on memory. For readdir, aufs calls
+vfs_readdir() internally for each dir on branches, merges their entries
+with eliminating the whiteout-ed ones, and sets it to file (dir)
+object. So the file object has its entry list until it is closed. The
+entry list will be updated when the file position is zero and becomes
+old. This decision is made in aufs automatically.
+
+The dynamically allocated memory block for the name of entries has a
+unit of 512 bytes (by default) and stores the names contiguously (no
+padding). Another block for each entry is handled by kmem_cache too.
+During building dir blocks, aufs creates hash list and judging whether
+the entry is whiteouted by its upper branch or already listed.
+The merged result is cached in the corresponding inode object and
+maintained by a customizable life-time option.
+
+Some people may call it can be a security hole or invite DoS attack
+since the opened and once readdir-ed dir (file object) holds its entry
+list and becomes a pressure for system memory. But I'd say it is similar
+to files under /proc or /sys. The virtual files in them also holds a
+memory page (generally) while they are opened. When an idea to reduce
+memory for them is introduced, it will be applied to aufs too.
+For those who really hate this situation, I've developed readdir(3)
+library which operates this merging in userspace. You just need to set
+LD_PRELOAD environment variable, and aufs will not consume no memory in
+kernel space for readdir(3).
+
+
+Workqueue
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Aufs sometimes requires privilege access to a branch. For instance,
+in copy-up/down operation. When a user process is going to make changes
+to a file which exists in the lower readonly branch only, and the mode
+of one of ancestor directories may not be writable by a user
+process. Here aufs copy-up the file with its ancestors and they may
+require privilege to set its owner/group/mode/etc.
+This is a typical case of a application character of aufs (see
+Introduction).
+
+Aufs uses workqueue synchronously for this case. It creates its own
+workqueue. The workqueue is a kernel thread and has privilege. Aufs
+passes the request to call mkdir or write (for example), and wait for
+its completion. This approach solves a problem of a signal handler
+simply.
+If aufs didn't adopt the workqueue and changed the privilege of the
+process, and if the mkdir/write call arises SIGXFSZ or other signal,
+then the user process might gain a privilege or the generated core file
+was owned by a superuser.
+
+Also aufs uses the system global workqueue ("events" kernel thread) too
+for asynchronous tasks, such like handling inotify/fsnotify, re-creating a
+whiteout base and etc. This is unrelated to a privilege.
+Most of aufs operation tries acquiring a rw_semaphore for aufs
+superblock at the beginning, at the same time waits for the completion
+of all queued asynchronous tasks.
+
+
+Whiteout
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+The whiteout in aufs is very similar to Unionfs's. That is represented
+by its filename. UnionMount takes an approach of a file mode, but I am
+afraid several utilities (find(1) or something) will have to support it.
+
+Basically the whiteout represents "logical deletion" which stops aufs to
+lookup further, but also it represents "dir is opaque" which also stop
+lookup.
+
+In aufs, rmdir(2) and rename(2) for dir uses whiteout alternatively.
+In order to make several functions in a single systemcall to be
+revertible, aufs adopts an approach to rename a directory to a temporary
+unique whiteouted name.
+For example, in rename(2) dir where the target dir already existed, aufs
+renames the target dir to a temporary unique whiteouted name before the
+actual rename on a branch and then handles other actions (make it opaque,
+update the attributes, etc). If an error happens in these actions, aufs
+simply renames the whiteouted name back and returns an error. If all are
+succeeded, aufs registers a function to remove the whiteouted unique
+temporary name completely and asynchronously to the system global
+workqueue.
+
+
+Copy-up
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+It is a well-known feature or concept.
+When user modifies a file on a readonly branch, aufs operate "copy-up"
+internally and makes change to the new file on the upper writable branch.
+When the trigger systemcall does not update the timestamps of the parent
+dir, aufs reverts it after copy-up.

+
+Lookup in a Branch
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Since aufs has a character of sub-VFS (see Introduction), it operates
+lookup for branches as VFS does. It may be a heavy work. Generally
+speaking struct nameidata is a bigger structure and includes many
+information. But almost all lookup operation in aufs is the simplest
+case, ie. lookup only an entry directly connected to its parent. Digging
+down the directory hierarchy is unnecessary.
+
+VFS has a function lookup_one_len() for that use, but it is not usable
+for a branch filesystem which requires struct nameidata. So aufs
+implements a simple lookup wrapper function. When a branch filesystem
+allows NULL as nameidata, it calls lookup_one_len(). Otherwise it builds
+a simplest nameidata and calls lookup_hash().
+Here aufs applies "a principle in NFSD", ie. if the filesystem supports
+NFS-export, then it has to support NULL as a nameidata parameter for
+->create(), ->lookup() and ->d_revalidate(). So the lookup wrapper in
+aufs tests if ->s_export_op in the branch is NULL or not.
+
+When a branch is a remote filesystem, aufs basically trusts its
+->d_revalidate(), also aufs forces the hardest revalidate tests for
+them.
+For d_revalidate, aufs implements three levels of revalidate tests. See
+"Revalidate Dentry and UDBA" in detail.
+
+
+Loopback Mount
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Basically aufs supports any type of filesystem and block device for a
+branch (actually there are some exceptions). But it is prohibited to add
+a loopback mounted one whose backend file exists in a filesystem which is
+already added to aufs. The reason is to protect aufs from a recursive
+lookup. If it was allowed, the aufs lookup operation might re-enter a
+lookup for the loopback mounted branch in the same context, and will
+cause a deadlock.
+
+
+Revalidate Dentry and UDBA (User's Direct Branch Access)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Generally VFS helpers re-validate a dentry as a part of lookup.
+0. digging down the directory hierarchy.
+1. lock the parent dir by its i_mutex.
+2. lookup the final (child) entry.
+3. revalidate it.
+4. call the actual operation (create, unlink, etc.)
+5. unlock the parent dir
+
+If the filesystem implements its ->d_revalidate() (step 3), then it is
+called. Actually aufs implements it and checks the dentry on a branch is
+still valid.
+But it is not enough. Because aufs has to release the lock for the
+parent dir on a branch at the end of ->lookup() (step 2) and
+->d_revalidate() (step 3) while the i_mutex of the aufs dir is still
+held by VFS.
+If the file on a branch is changed directly, eg. bypassing aufs, after
+aufs released the lock, then the subsequent operation may cause
+something unpleasant result.
+
+This situation is a result of VFS architecture, ->lookup() and
+->d_revalidate() is separated. But I never say it is wrong. It is a good
+design from VFS's point of view. It is just not suitable for sub-VFS
+character in aufs.
+
+Aufs supports such case by three level of revalidation which is
+selectable by user.
+1. Simple Revalidate
+   Addition to the native flow in VFS's, confirm the child-parent
+   relationship on the branch just after locking the parent dir on the
+   branch in the "actual operation" (step 4). When this validation
+   fails, aufs returns EBUSY. ->d_revalidate() (step 3) in aufs still
+   checks the validation of the dentry on branches.
+2. Monitor Changes Internally by Inotify/Fsnotify
+   Addition to above, in the "actual operation" (step 4) aufs re-lookup
+   the dentry on the branch, and returns EBUSY if it finds different
+   dentry.
+   Additionally, aufs sets the inotify/fsnotify watch for every dir on branches
+   during it is in cache. When the event is notified, aufs registers a
+   function to kernel 'events' thread by schedule_work(). And the
+   function sets some special status to the cached aufs dentry and inode
+   private data. If they are not cached, then aufs has nothing to
+   do. When the same file is accessed through aufs (step 0-3) later,
+   aufs will detect the status and refresh all necessary data.
+   In this mode, aufs has to ignore the event which is fired by aufs
+   itself.
+3. No Extra Validation
+   This is the simplest test and doesn't add any additional revalidation
+   test, and skip therevalidatin in step 4. It is useful and improves
+   aufs performance when system surely hide the aufs branches from user,
+   by over-mounting something (or another method).

+
+Branch Manipulation
+
+Since aufs supports dynamic branch manipulation, ie. add/remove a branch
+and changing its permission/attribute, there are a lot of works to do.
+
+
+Add a Branch
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+o Confirm the adding dir exists outside of aufs, including loopback
+  mount.
+- and other various attributes...
+o Initialize the xino file and whiteout bases if necessary.
+  See struct.txt.
+
+o Check the owner/group/mode of the directory
+  When the owner/group/mode of the adding directory differs from the
+  existing branch, aufs issues a warning because it may impose a
+  security risk.
+  For example, when a upper writable branch has a world writable empty
+  top directory, a malicious user can create any files on the writable
+  branch directly, like copy-up and modify manually. If something like
+  /etc/{passwd,shadow} exists on the lower readonly branch but the upper
+  writable branch, and the writable branch is world-writable, then a
+  malicious guy may create /etc/passwd on the writable branch directly
+  and the infected file will be valid in aufs.
+  I am afraid it can be a security issue, but nothing to do except
+  producing a warning.
+
+
+Delete a Branch
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+o Confirm the deleting branch is not busy
+  To be general, there is one merit to adopt "remount" interface to
+  manipulate branches. It is to discard caches. At deleting a branch,
+  aufs checks the still cached (and connected) dentries and inodes. If
+  there are any, then they are all in-use. An inode without its
+  corresponding dentry can be alive alone (for example, inotify/fsnotify case).
+
+  For the cached one, aufs checks whether the same named entry exists on
+  other branches.
+  If the cached one is a directory, because aufs provides a merged view
+  to users, as long as one dir is left on any branch aufs can show the
+  dir to users. In this case, the branch can be removed from aufs.
+  Otherwise aufs rejects deleting the branch.
+
+  If any file on the deleting branch is opened by aufs, then aufs
+  rejects deleting.
+
+
+Modify the Permission of a Branch
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+o Re-initialize or remove the xino file and whiteout bases if necessary.
+  See struct.txt.
+
+o rw --> ro: Confirm the modifying branch is not busy
+  Aufs rejects the request if any of these conditions are true.
+  - a file on the branch is mmap-ed.
+  - a regular file on the branch is opened for write and there is no
+    same named entry on the upper branch.

+
+Policies to Select One among Multiple Writable Branches
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+When the number of writable branch is more than one, aufs has to decide
+the target branch for file creation or copy-up. By default, the highest
+writable branch which has the parent (or ancestor) dir of the target
+file is chosen (top-down-parent policy).
+By user's request, aufs implements some other policies to select the
+writable branch, for file creation two policies, round-robin and
+most-free-space policies. For copy-up three policies, top-down-parent,
+bottom-up-parent and bottom-up policies.
+
+As expected, the round-robin policy selects the branch in circular. When
+you have two writable branches and creates 10 new files, 5 files will be
+created for each branch. mkdir(2) systemcall is an exception. When you
+create 10 new directories, all will be created on the same branch.
+And the most-free-space policy selects the one which has most free
+space among the writable branches. The amount of free space will be
+checked by aufs internally, and users can specify its time interval.
+
+The policies for copy-up is more simple,
+top-down-parent is equivalent to the same named on in create policy,
+bottom-up-parent selects the writable branch where the parent dir
+exists and the nearest upper one from the copyup-source,
+bottom-up selects the nearest upper writable branch from the
+copyup-source, regardless the existence of the parent dir.
+
+There are some rules or exceptions to apply these policies.
+- If there is a readonly branch above the policy-selected branch and
+  the parent dir is marked as opaque (a variation of whiteout), or the
+  target (creating) file is whiteout-ed on the upper readonly branch,
+  then the result of the policy is ignored and the target file will be
+  created on the nearest upper writable branch than the readonly branch.
+- If there is a writable branch above the policy-selected branch and
+  the parent dir is marked as opaque or the target file is whiteouted
+  on the branch, then the result of the policy is ignored and the target
+  file will be created on the highest one among the upper writable
+  branches who has diropq or whiteout. In case of whiteout, aufs removes
+  it as usual.
+- link(2) and rename(2) systemcalls are exceptions in every policy.
+  They try selecting the branch where the source exists as possible
+  since copyup a large file will take long time. If it can't be,
+  ie. the branch where the source exists is readonly, then they will
+  follow the copyup policy.
+- There is an exception for rename(2) when the target exists.
+  If the rename target exists, aufs compares the index of the branches
+  where the source and the target exists and selects the higher
+  one. If the selected branch is readonly, then aufs follows the
+  copyup policy.

+
+mmap(2) -- File Memory Mapping
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+In aufs, the file-mapped pages are handled by a branch fs directly, no
+interaction with aufs. It means aufs_mmap() calls the branch fs's
+->mmap().
+This approach is simple and good, but there is one problem.
+Under /proc, several entries show the mmap-ped files by its path (with
+device and inode number), and the printed path will be the path on the
+branch fs's instead of virtual aufs's.
+This is not a problem in most cases, but some utilities lsof(1) (and its
+user) may expect the path on aufs.
+
+To address this issue, aufs adds a new member called vm_prfile in struct
+vm_area_struct (and struct vm_region). The original vm_file points to
+the file on the branch fs in order to handle everything correctly as
+usual. The new vm_prfile points to a virtual file in aufs, and the
+show-functions in procfs refers to vm_prfile if it is set.
+Also we need to maintain several other places where touching vm_file
+such like
+- fork()/clone() copies vma and the reference count of vm_file is
+  incremented.
+- merging vma maintains the ref count too.
+
+This is not a good approach. It just faking the printed path. But it
+leaves all behaviour around f_mapping unchanged. This is surely an
+advantage.
+Actually aufs had adopted another complicated approach which calls
+generic_file_mmap() and handles struct vm_operations_struct. In this
+approach, aufs met a hard problem and I could not solve it without
+switching the approach.

+
+Export Aufs via NFS
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Here is an approach.
+- like xino/xib, add a new file 'xigen' which stores aufs inode
+  generation.
+- iget_locked(): initialize aufs inode generation for a new inode, and
+  store it in xigen file.
+- destroy_inode(): increment aufs inode generation and store it in xigen
+  file. it is necessary even if it is not unlinked, because any data of
+  inode may be changed by UDBA.
+- encode_fh(): for a root dir, simply return FILEID_ROOT. otherwise
+  build file handle by
+  + branch id (4 bytes)
+  + superblock generation (4 bytes)
+  + inode number (4 or 8 bytes)
+  + parent dir inode number (4 or 8 bytes)
+  + inode generation (4 bytes))
+  + return value of exportfs_encode_fh() for the parent on a branch (4
+    bytes)
+  + file handle for a branch (by exportfs_encode_fh())
+- fh_to_dentry():
+  + find the index of a branch from its id in handle, and check it is
+    still exist in aufs.
+  + 1st level: get the inode number from handle and search it in cache.
+  + 2nd level: if not found, get the parent inode number from handle and
+    search it in cache. and then open the parent dir, find the matching
+    inode number by vfs_readdir() and get its name, and call
+    lookup_one_len() for the target dentry.
+  + 3rd level: if the parent dir is not cached, call
+    exportfs_decode_fh() for a branch and get the parent on a branch,
+    build a pathname of it, convert it a pathname in aufs, call
+    path_lookup(). now aufs gets a parent dir dentry, then handle it as
+    the 2nd level.
+  + to open the dir, aufs needs struct vfsmount. aufs keeps vfsmount
+    for every branch, but not itself. to get this, (currently) aufs
+    searches in current->nsproxy->mnt_ns list. it may not be a good
+    idea, but I didn't get other approach.
+  + test the generation of the gotten inode.
+- every inode operation: they may get EBUSY due to UDBA. in this case,
+  convert it into ESTALE for NFSD.
+- readdir(): call lockdep_on/off() because filldir in NFSD calls
+  lookup_one_len(), vfs_getattr(), encode_fh() and others.

+
+Show Whiteout Mode (shwh)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Generally aufs hides the name of whiteouts. But in some cases, to show
+them is very useful for users. For instance, creating a new middle layer
+(branch) by merging existing layers.
+
+(borrowing aufs1 HOW-TO from a user, Michael Towers)
+When you have three branches,
+- Bottom: 'system', squashfs (underlying base system), read-only
+- Middle: 'mods', squashfs, read-only
+- Top: 'overlay', ram (tmpfs), read-write
+
+The top layer is loaded at boot time and saved at shutdown, to preserve
+the changes made to the system during the session.
+When larger changes have been made, or smaller changes have accumulated,
+the size of the saved top layer data grows. At this point, it would be
+nice to be able to merge the two overlay branches ('mods' and 'overlay')
+and rewrite the 'mods' squashfs, clearing the top layer and thus
+restoring save and load speed.
+
+This merging is simplified by the use of another aufs mount, of just the
+two overlay branches using the 'shwh' option.
+# mount -t aufs -o ro,shwh,br:/livesys/overlay=ro+wh:/livesys/mods=rr+wh \
+	aufs /livesys/merge_union
+
+A merged view of these two branches is then available at
+/livesys/merge_union, and the new feature is that the whiteouts are
+visible!
+Note that in 'shwh' mode the aufs mount must be 'ro', which will disable
+writing to all branches. Also the default mode for all branches is 'ro'.
+It is now possible to save the combined contents of the two overlay
+branches to a new squashfs, e.g.:
+# mksquashfs /livesys/merge_union /path/to/newmods.squash
+
+This new squashfs archive can be stored on the boot device and the
+initramfs will use it to replace the old one at the next boot.

+
+Dynamically customizable FS operations
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Generally FS operations (struct inode_operations, struct
+address_space_operations, struct file_operations, etc.) are defined as
+"static const", but it never means that FS have only one set of
+operation. Some FS have multiple sets of them. For instance, ext2 has
+three sets, one for XIP, for NOBH, and for normal.
+Since aufs overrides and redirects these operations, sometimes aufs has
+to change its behaviour according to the branch FS type. More imporantly
+VFS acts differently if a function (member in the struct) is set or
+not. It means aufs should have several sets of operations and select one
+among them according to the branch FS definition.
+
+In order to solve this problem and not to affect the behavour of VFS,
+aufs defines these operations dynamically. For instance, aufs defines
+aio_read function for struct file_operations, but it may not be set to
+the file_operations. When the branch FS doesn't have it, aufs doesn't
+set it to its file_operations while the function definition itself is
+still alive. So the behaviour of io_submit(2) will not change, and it
+will return an error when aio_read is not defined.
+
+The lifetime of these dynamically generated operation object is
+maintained by aufs branch object. When the branch is removed from aufs,
+the reference counter of the object is decremented. When it reaches
+zero, the dynamically generated operation object will be freed.
+
+This approach is designed to support AIO (io_submit), Direcit I/O and
+XIP mainly.
+Currently this approach is applied to file_operations and
+vm_operations_struct for regular files only.

+
+Plan
+
+Restoring some features which was implemented in aufs1.
+They were dropped in aufs2 in order to make source files simpler and
+easier to be reviewed.
+
+
+Test Only the Highest One for the Directory Permission (dirperm1 option)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Let's try case study.
+- aufs has two branches, upper readwrite and lower readonly.
+  /au = /rw + /ro
+- "dirA" exists under /ro, but /rw. and its mode is 0700.
+- user invoked "chmod a+rx /au/dirA"
+- then "dirA" becomes world readable?
+
+In this case, /ro/dirA is still 0700 since it exists in readonly branch,
+or it may be a natively readonly filesystem. If aufs respects the lower
+branch, it should not respond readdir request from other users. But user
+allowed it by chmod. Should really aufs rejects showing the entries
+under /ro/dirA?
+
+To be honest, I don't have a best solution for this case. So I
+implemented 'dirperm1' and 'nodirperm1' option in aufs1, and leave it to
+users.
+When dirperm1 is specified, aufs checks only the highest one for the
+directory permission, and shows the entries. Otherwise, as usual, checks
+every dir existing on all branches and rejects the request.
+
+As a side effect, dirperm1 option improves the performance of aufs
+because the number of permission check is reduced.
+
+
+Being Another Aufs's Readonly Branch (robr)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+Aufs1 allows aufs to be another aufs's readonly branch.
+This feature was developed by a user's request. But it may not be used
+currecnly.
+
+
+Copy-up on Open (coo=)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+By default the internal copy-up is executed when it is really necessary.
+It is not done when a file is opened for writing, but when write(2) is
+done. Users who have many (over 100) branches want to know and analyse
+when and what file is copied-up. To insert a new upper branch which
+contains such files only may improve the performance of aufs.
+
+Aufs1 implemented "coo=none | leaf | all" option.
+
+
+Refresh the Opened File (refrof)
+----------------------------------------------------------------------
+This option is implemented in aufs1 but incomplete.
+
+When user reads from a file, he expects to get its latest filedata
+generally. If the file is removed and a new same named file is created,
+the content he gets is unchanged, ie. the unlinked filedata.
+
+Let's try case study again.
+- aufs has two branches.
+  /au = /rw + /ro
+- "fileA" exists under /ro, but /rw.
+- user opened "/au/fileA".
+- he or someone else inserts a branch (/new) between /rw and /ro.
+  /au = /rw + /new + /ro
+- the new branch has "fileA".
+- user reads from the opened "fileA"
+- which filedata should aufs return, from /ro or /new?
+
+Some people says it has to be "from /ro" and it is a semantics of Unix.
+The others say it should be "from /new" because the file is not removed
+and it is equivalent to the case of someone else modifies the file.
+
+Here again I don't have a best and final answer. I got an idea to
+implement 'refrof' and 'norefrof' option. When 'refrof' (REFResh the
+Opened File) is specified (by default), aufs returns the filedata from
+/new.
+Otherwise from /new.

+Aufs3 -- advanced multi layered unification filesystem version 3.x
+http://aufs.sf.net
+Junjiro R. Okajima
+
+
+0. Introduction
+----------------------------------------
+In the early days, aufs was entirely re-designed and re-implemented
+Unionfs Version 1.x series. After many original ideas, approaches,
+improvements and implementations, it becomes totally different from
+Unionfs while keeping the basic features.
+Recently, Unionfs Version 2.x series begin taking some of the same
+approaches to aufs1's.
+Unionfs is being developed by Professor Erez Zadok at Stony Brook
+University and his team.
+
+Aufs3 supports linux-3.0 and later.
+If you want older kernel version support, try aufs2-2.6.git or
+aufs2-standalone.git repository, aufs1 from CVS on SourceForge.
+
+Note: it becomes clear that "Aufs was rejected. Let's give it up."
+According to Christoph Hellwig, linux rejects all union-type filesystems
+but UnionMount.
+<http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=123938533724484&w=2>
+
+
+1. Features
+----------------------------------------
+- unite several directories into a single virtual filesystem. The member
+  directory is called as a branch.
+- you can specify the permission flags to the branch, which are 'readonly',
+  'readwrite' and 'whiteout-able.'
+- by upper writable branch, internal copyup and whiteout, files/dirs on
+  readonly branch are modifiable logically.
+- dynamic branch manipulation, add, del.
+- etc...
+
+Also there are many enhancements in aufs1, such as:

+2. Download
+----------------------------------------
+There were three GIT trees for aufs3, aufs3-linux.git,
+aufs3-standalone.git, and aufs-util.git. Note that there is no "3" in
+"aufs-util.git."
+While the aufs-util is always necessary, you need either of aufs3-linux
+or aufs3-standalone.
+
+The aufs3-linux tree includes the whole linux mainline GIT tree,
+git://git.kernel.org/.../torvalds/linux.git.
+And you cannot select CONFIG_AUFS_FS=m for this version, eg. you cannot
+build aufs3 as an externel kernel module.
+
+On the other hand, the aufs3-standalone tree has only aufs source files
+and necessary patches, and you can select CONFIG_AUFS_FS=m.
+
+You will find GIT branches whose name is in form of "aufs3.x" where "x"
+represents the linux kernel version, "linux-3.x". For instance,
+"aufs3.0" is for linux-3.0. For latest "linux-3.x-rcN", use
+"aufs3.x-rcN" branch.
+
+o aufs3-linux tree
+$ git clone --reference /your/linux/git/tree \
+	git://aufs.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/aufs/aufs3-linux.git \
+	aufs3-linux.git
+- if you don't have linux GIT tree, then remove "--reference ..."
+$ cd aufs3-linux.git
+$ git checkout origin/aufs3.0
+
+o aufs3-standalone tree
+$ git clone git://aufs.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/aufs/aufs3-standalone.git \
+	aufs3-standalone.git
+$ cd aufs3-standalone.git
+$ git checkout origin/aufs3.0
+
+o aufs-util tree
+$ git clone git://aufs.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/aufs/aufs-util.git \
+	aufs-util.git
+$ cd aufs-util.git
+$ git checkout origin/aufs3.0
+
+Note: The 3.x-rcN branch is to be used with `rc' kernel versions ONLY.
+The minor version number, 'x' in '3.x', of aufs may not always
+follow the minor version number of the kernel.
+Because changes in the kernel that cause the use of a new
+minor version number do not always require changes to aufs-util.
+
+Since aufs-util has its own minor version number, you may not be
+able to find a GIT branch in aufs-util for your kernel's
+exact minor version number.
+In this case, you should git-checkout the branch for the
+nearest lower number.
+
+For (an unreleased) example:
+If you are using "linux-3.10" and the "aufs3.10" branch
+does not exit in aufs-util repository, then "aufs3.9", "aufs3.8"
+or something numerically smaller is the branch for your kernel.
+
+Also you can view all branches by
+	$ git branch -a
+
+
+3. Configuration and Compilation
+----------------------------------------
+Make sure you have git-checkout'ed the correct branch.
+
+For aufs3-linux tree,
+- enable CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL and CONFIG_AUFS_FS.
+- set other aufs configurations if necessary.
+
+For aufs3-standalone tree,
+There are several ways to build.
+
+1.
+- apply ./aufs3-kbuild.patch to your kernel source files.
+- apply ./aufs3-base.patch too.
+- apply ./aufs3-proc_map.patch too, if you want to make /proc/PID/maps (and
+  others including lsof(1)) show the file path on aufs instead of the
+  path on the branch fs.
+- apply ./aufs3-standalone.patch too, if you have a plan to set
+  CONFIG_AUFS_FS=m. otherwise you don't need ./aufs3-standalone.patch.
+- copy ./{Documentation,fs,include/linux/aufs_type.h} files to your
+  kernel source tree. Never copy ./include/linux/Kbuild.
+- enable CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL and CONFIG_AUFS_FS, you can select either
+  =m or =y.
+- and build your kernel as usual.
+- install the built kernel.
+- install the header files too by "make headers_install".
+- and reboot your system.
+
+2.
+- module only (CONFIG_AUFS_FS=m).
+- apply ./aufs3-base.patch to your kernel source files.
+- apply ./aufs3-proc_map.patch too to your kernel source files,
+  if you want to make /proc/PID/maps (and others including lsof(1)) show
+  the file path on aufs instead of the path on the branch fs.
+- apply ./aufs3-standalone.patch too.
+- build your kernel, don't forget "make headers_install", and reboot.
+- edit ./config.mk and set other aufs configurations if necessary.
+  Note: You should read ./fs/aufs/Kconfig carefully which describes
+  every aufs configurations.
+- build the module by simple "make".
+- you can specify ${KDIR} make variable which points to your kernel
+  source tree.
+- install the files
+  + run "make install" to install the aufs module, or copy the built
+    ./aufs.ko to /lib/modules/... and run depmod -a (or reboot simply).
+  + run "make headers_install" to install the aufs header file (you can
+    specify DESTDIR), or copty ./usr/include/linux/aufs_type.h to
+    /usr/include/linux or wherever you like.
+- no need to apply aufs3-kbuild.patch, nor copying source files to your
+  kernel source tree.
+
+Note: The haeder file aufs_type.h is necessary to build aufs-util
+      as well as "make headers_install" in the kernel source tree.
+      headers_install is subject to be forgotten, but it is essentially
+      necessary, not only for building aufs-util.
+      You may not meet problems without headers_install in some older
+      version though.
+
+And then,
+- read README in aufs-util, build and install it
+- note that your distribution may contain an obsoleted version of
+  aufs_type.h in /usr/include/linux or something. When you build aufs
+  utilities, make sure that your compiler refers the correct aufs header
+  file which is built by "make headers_install."
+- if you want to use readdir(3) in userspace or pathconf(3) wrapper,
+  then run "make install_ulib" too. And refer to the aufs manual in
+  detail.
+
+
+4. Usage
+----------------------------------------
+At first, make sure aufs-util are installed, and please read the aufs
+manual, aufs.5 in aufs-util.git tree.
+$ man -l aufs.5
+
+And then,
+$ mkdir /tmp/rw /tmp/aufs
+# mount -t aufs -o br=/tmp/rw:${HOME} none /tmp/aufs
+
+Here is another example. The result is equivalent.
+# mount -t aufs -o br=/tmp/rw=rw:${HOME}=ro none /tmp/aufs
+  Or
+# mount -t aufs -o br:/tmp/rw none /tmp/aufs
+# mount -o remount,append:${HOME} /tmp/aufs
+
+Then, you can see whole tree of your home dir through /tmp/aufs. If
+you modify a file under /tmp/aufs, the one on your home directory is
+not affected, instead the same named file will be newly created under
+/tmp/rw. And all of your modification to a file will be applied to
+the one under /tmp/rw. This is called the file based Copy on Write
+(COW) method.
+Aufs mount options are described in aufs.5.
+If you run chroot or something and make your aufs as a root directory,
+then you need to customize the shutdown script. See the aufs manual in
+detail.
+
+Additionally, there are some sample usages of aufs which are a
+diskless system with network booting, and LiveCD over NFS.
+See sample dir in CVS tree on SourceForge.
+
+
+5. Contact
+----------------------------------------
+When you have any problems or strange behaviour in aufs, please let me
+know with:
+- /proc/mounts (instead of the output of mount(8))
+- /sys/module/aufs/*
+- /sys/fs/aufs/* (if you have them)
+- /debug/aufs/* (if you have them)
+- linux kernel version
+  if your kernel is not plain, for example modified by distributor,
+  the url where i can download its source is necessary too.
+- aufs version which was printed at loading the module or booting the
+  system, instead of the date you downloaded.
+- configuration (define/undefine CONFIG_AUFS_xxx)
+- kernel configuration or /proc/config.gz (if you have it)
+- behaviour which you think to be incorrect
+- actual operation, reproducible one is better
+- mailto: aufs-users at lists.sourceforge.net
+
+Usually, I don't watch the Public Areas(Bugs, Support Requests, Patches,
+and Feature Requests) on SourceForge. Please join and write to
+aufs-users ML.

+ * file I/O. Aufs needs to stop lockdep in aufs_mmap() though.
+ * It means that when aufs acquires si_rwsem for write, the process should never
+ * acquire mmap_sem.
+ *
+ * Actually aufs_readdir() holds [fdi]i_rwsem before mmap_sem, but this is not a
+ * problem either since any directory is not able to be mmap-ed.

+config AUFS_FS
+	tristate "Aufs (Advanced multi layered unification filesystem) support"
+	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
+	help
+	Aufs is a stackable unification filesystem such as Unionfs,
+	which unifies several directories and provides a merged single
+	directory.
+	In the early days, aufs was entirely re-designed and
+	re-implemented Unionfs Version 1.x series. Introducing many
+	original ideas, approaches and improvements, it becomes totally
+	different from Unionfs while keeping the basic features.
+

+	help
+	Specifies the maximum number of branches (or member directories)

+	bool "Detect direct branch access (bypassing aufs)"
+	help
+	If you want to modify files on branches directly, eg. bypassing aufs,
+	and want aufs to detect the changes of them fully, then enable this
+	option and use 'udba=notify' mount option.
+	Currently there is only one available configuration, "fsnotify".

+
+config AUFS_RDU
+	bool "Readdir in userspace"
+	help
+	Aufs has two methods to provide a merged view for a directory,
+	by a user-space library and by kernel-space natively. The latter
+	is always enabled but sometimes large and slow.
+	If you enable this option, install the library in aufs2-util
+	package, and set some environment variables for your readdir(3),
+	then the work will be handled in user-space which generally
+	shows better performance in most cases.
+	See detail in aufs.5.
+
+config AUFS_PROC_MAP
+	bool "support for /proc/maps and lsof(1)"
+	depends on PROC_FS
+	help
+	When you issue mmap(2) in aufs, it is actually a direct mmap(2)
+	call to the file on the branch fs since the file in aufs is
+	purely virtual. And the file path printed in /proc/maps (and
+	others) will be the path on the branch fs. In most cases, it
+	does no harm. But some utilities like lsof(1) may confuse since
+	the utility or user may expect the file path in aufs to be
+	printed.
+	To address this issue, aufs provides a patch which introduces a
+	new member called vm_prfile into struct vm_are_struct. The patch
+	is meaningless without enabling this configuration since nobody
+	sets the new vm_prfile member.
+	If you don't apply the patch, then enabling this configuration
+	will cause a compile error.
+	This approach is fragile since if someone else make some changes
+	around vm_file, then vm_prfile may not work anymore. As a
+	workaround such case, aufs provides this configuration. If you
+	disable it, then lsof(1) may produce incorrect result but the
+	problem will be gone even if the aufs patch is applied (I hope).
+
+config AUFS_SP_IATTR
+	bool "Respect the attributes (mtime/ctime mainly) of special files"
+	help
+	When you write something to a special file, some attributes of it
+	(mtime/ctime mainly) may be updated. Generally such updates are
+	less important (actually some device drivers and NFS ignore
+	it). But some applications (such like test program) requires
+	such updates. If you need these updates, then enable this
+	configuration which introduces some overhead.
+	Currently this configuration handles FIFO only.
+
+config AUFS_SHWH
+	bool "Show whiteouts"
+	help
+	If you want to make the whiteouts in aufs visible, then enable
+	this option and specify 'shwh' mount option. Although it may
+	sounds like philosophy or something, but in technically it
+	simply shows the name of whiteout with keeping its behaviour.
+
+config AUFS_BR_RAMFS
+	bool "Ramfs (initramfs/rootfs) as an aufs branch"
+	help
+	If you want to use ramfs as an aufs branch fs, then enable this
+	option. Generally tmpfs is recommended.
+	Aufs prohibited them to be a branch fs by default, because
+	initramfs becomes unusable after switch_root or something
+	generally. If you sets initramfs as an aufs branch and boot your
+	system by switch_root, you will meet a problem easily since the
+	files in initramfs may be inaccessible.
+	Unless you are going to use ramfs as an aufs branch fs without
+	switch_root or something, leave it N.
+
+config AUFS_BR_FUSE
+	bool "Fuse fs as an aufs branch"
+	depends on FUSE_FS
+	select AUFS_POLL
+	help
+	If you want to use fuse-based userspace filesystem as an aufs
+	branch fs, then enable this option.
+	It implements the internal poll(2) operation which is
+	implemented by fuse only (curretnly).
+
+config AUFS_POLL

+	help
+	Automatic configuration for internal use.
+
+config AUFS_BR_HFSPLUS
