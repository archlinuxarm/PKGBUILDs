======

The ALARM Github repository will only contain PKGBUILDs
of packages that need to be modified from Arch Linux ABS
PKGBUILDs. The rest are presumed to be buildable from
ABS with no modifications and run as intended without
post-installation ARM-specific changes.

If it's not here, it builds directly from ABS without
modifications.
