# crypttab: Mappings for encrypted partitions
#
# Each mapped device will be created in /dev/mapper, so your /etc/fstab
# should use the /dev/mapper/{NAME} paths for encrypted devices.
#
# Each PASSWORD field can be an absolute pathname to a key file (starting
# with a slash, recommended) or a literal string that will be used as
# a passphrase. To use special characters in the passphrase, surround it
# by quotes, the usual bash quoting rules apply.
# There are two special keywords that cannot be used as passphrases:
#   - ASK  ask for a passphrase on boot
#   - SWAP use a random key and create a swapspace afterwards
# WARNING: use the SWAP keyword carefully, as it overwrites the data
#          on the specified partition
# 
# To create a key file:
#    hashalot -n 32 ripemd160 >/etc/crytfs.key
# or
#    dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/cryptfs.key bs=256 count=1
#
# To pass additional options to cryptsetup for non-LUKS partitions, use the
# fourth column.
#
# NOTE: Do not list your root (/) partition here, it must be set up
#       beforehand by the initramfs (/etc/mkinitcpio.conf).
