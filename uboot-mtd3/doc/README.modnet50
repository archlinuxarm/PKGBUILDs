--------------------------------------

The port based upon an early (partial complete)
armboot-port from Stephan Linz for the ModNET50 Board.


Overview:

- board with Netsilicon NET+50 ARM7TDMI CPU without MMU
- 16 MB SDRAM
- 2 MB Flash (MBL29LV160BE)
- 10/100 Ethernet PHY (LXT971A)


Current Configuration (include/configs/modnet50.h):

Memory Map: 0x00000000 - 0x00FFFFFF 16M SDRAM
	    0x10000000 - 0x101FFFFF  2M Flash

The Flash uses a BB-Architectur with 35 sectors
(0:16K; 1,2:8K; 3:32K; 4-34:64K). U-Boot is located in
the first 5 sectors.

The environment is located at the end of the 4th Flash
sector (0x1001C000-0x1001FFFF).

Build:

U-boot should be build by using the ELDK Toolchain (arm-linux-*).

	make modnet50_config
	make


Status:

Everything seems to work fine. Booting images was tested by
booting uCLinux (with and without a separate ramdisk image) from
flash.
