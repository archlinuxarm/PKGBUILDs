Cloud Engines XCE Kernel Module
===============================

About: This is the "confidential" Cloud Engines XCE.ko source code.
This module "controls" the plug computer (LEDs and drive mounting are
examples), and allows for a connection to my.pogoplug.com.

We (Plugbox Linux) will build kernel modules for kernels 2.6.33 onward,
but have included instructions below.

How to build:

1. Download kernel source (http://kernel.org), extract it,
make a config file (make menuconfig or download one from
http://sheeva.with-linux.com/sheeva and rename it to .config).

2. Run "make oldconfig" if you downloaded a configuration file from
With-Linux.

3. Run "make uImage". Grab a pot or two of coffee. It'll take a
couple of hours.

4. Finally, you can go to this directory (pogo-xce) and type "make".
You'll get a nice xce.ko file in return. It should take about a minute.
