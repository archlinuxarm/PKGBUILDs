>>> xorg-server has now the ability to run without root rights with
    the help of systemd-logind. xserver will fail to run if not launched
    from the same virtual terminal as was used to log in.
    Without root rights, log files will be in ~/.local/share/xorg/ directory.

    Old behavior can be restored through Xorg.wrap config file.
    See Xorg.wrap man page (man xorg.wrap).
