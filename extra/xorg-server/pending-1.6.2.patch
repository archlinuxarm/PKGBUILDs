Subject: Bug #6428, #16458, #21464: Fix crash due to uninitialized VModMap fields.

In ProcXkbGetKbdByName, mrep.firstVModMapKey, .nVModMapKeys and
.totalVModMapKeys were not initialized, contained random values and caused
accesses to unallocated and later modified memory, causing
XkbSizeVirtualModMap and XkbWriteVirtualModMap to see different number of
nonzero values, resulting in writes past the end of an array in XkbSendMap.

This patch initializes those values sensibly and reverts commits 5c0a2088 and
6dd4fc46, which have been plain non-sense.

Subject: xfree86: restore default off for DontZap

Zapping is triggered by xkb these days, so note in the man page that it's the
Terminate_Server action. Since it's XKB, personal preferences towards or
against zapping should be achieved through xkb rulesets.
If Terminate_Server is not in the xkb actions, then we can't zap anyway and we
don't need a default of DontZap "on".

This patch restores the old meaning of DontZap - disallow zapping altogether,
regardless of XKB's current keymap.
Ideally, this patch should be accompanied by b0f64bdab00db652e in
xkeyboard-config.

From f9dd45e7b88a64892961a481678688dffd58c74c Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Julien Cristau <jcristau@debian.org>
Date: Mon, 18 May 2009 19:01:46 +0200
Subject: [PATCH] Change default for ExaOptimizeMigration to false
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Quoting Michel D채nzer in <1234862541.4823.541.camel@thor>:

  Unfortunately, there are still bugs left in EXA which prevent it from
  working 100% correctly with the option enabled, see

  http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16416

  http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19940

So disable it for now to avoid corruption.
