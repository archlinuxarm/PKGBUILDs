# Device nodes are created by nvidia-modprobe, which is called by the nvidia DDX.
# In case the DDX is not started, the device nodes are never created, so call
# nvidia-modprobe in the udev rules to cover the Wayland/EGLStream and compute
# case without a started display. In the case where vfio-pci is used
# nvidia-modprobe should not be invoked.
