<h1>The Artistic License</h1>
<p><tt></p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a<br />
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some<br />
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,<br />
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute<br />
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make<br />
reasonable modifications.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the<br />
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files<br />
	created through textual modification.</li>
<li>	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been<br />
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes<br />
	of the Copyright Holder.</li>
<li>	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or<br />
	copyrights for the package.</li>
<li>	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing<br />
	this Package.</li>
<li>	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the<br />
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,<br />
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the<br />
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large<br />
	as a market that must bear the fee.)</li>
<li>	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item<br />
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.<br />
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it<br />
	under the same conditions they received it.</li>
</ul>
<p>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the<br />
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you<br />
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</p>
<p>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications<br />
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package<br />
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</p>
<p>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided<br />
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and<br />
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the<br />
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them<br />
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or<br />
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive<br />
    site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include<br />
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.</p>
<p>b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</p>
<p>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict<br />
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide<br />
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly<br />
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</p>
<p>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or<br />
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,<br />
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where<br />
    to get the Standard Version.</p>
<p>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of<br />
    the Package with your modifications.</p>
<p>c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding<br />
    Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables<br />
    non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual<br />
    pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get<br />
    the Standard Version.</p>
<p>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this<br />
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.<br />
You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,<br />
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly<br />
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software<br />
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a<br />
product of your own.</p>
<p>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as<br />
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall<br />
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated<br />
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this<br />
Package.</p>
<p>7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package<br />
shall not be considered part of this Package.</p>
<p>8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote<br />
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.</p>
<p>9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR<br />
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED<br />
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
