#
# /usr/sbin/pure-config.pl /usr/etc/pure-ftpd.conf

# Please don't forget to have a look at documentation at

# If the previous option is set to "no", members of the following group

# Per-user concurrency limits. It will only work if the FTP server has

# When a file is uploaded and there is already a previous version of the file
# with the same name, the old file will neither get removed nor truncated.
# Upload will take place in a temporary file and once the upload is complete,

# script is being uploaded, the web server will still serve the old version and
# immediatly switch to the new one as soon as the full file will have been
# transfered. This option is incompatible with virtual quotas.

# NoTruncate               yes



# This option can accept three values :

# Do _not_ uncomment this blindly. Be sure that :
# 1) Your server has been compiled with SSL/TLS support (--with-tls),
# 2) A valid certificate is in place,
# 3) Only compatible clients will log in.
