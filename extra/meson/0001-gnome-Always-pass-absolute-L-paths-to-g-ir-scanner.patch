Subject: [PATCH] gnome: Always pass absolute -L paths to g-ir-scanner

g-ir-scanner does not convert relative -L paths to runtime paths which
are added to -Wl,-rpath and LD_LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
/ PATH. This means that the local library will either not be found at
runtime (while building introspection data), or the system-wide
library will be picked instead.

See: giscanner/ccompiler.py:get_internal_link_flags() in
gobject-introspection for more details.
