# GDM System Defaults Configuration file.
#
# This file should not be updated by hand.  Since GDM 2.13.0.4, configuration
# choices in the GDM Custom Configuration file will override the default
# values specified in this file.  This GDM System Defaults Configuration file
# may be overwritten on upgrade, so to ensure that your configuration choices
# are not lost, please make sure that your changes are made only the GDM Custom 
# Configuration file.  The GDM Custom Configuration file is found at the
# following location:
#
# /etc/gdm/custom.conf
#
# If you were using an older version of GDM, your system may have the the older
# gdm.conf configuration file on the system.  If so, then this file is used
# instead of the GDM Custom Configuration file for backwards support.  If you
# make changes to the GDM Custom Configuration file and they seem to not be
# taking effect, this is likely the problem.  Consider migrating your
# configuration to the new configuration file and removing the gdm.conf file.
#
# You can use the gdmsetup program to graphically edit the gdm.conf-custom
# file.  Note that gdmsetup does not support every option in this file, just
# the most common ones that users want to change.  If you feel that gdmsetup
# should support additional configuration options, please file a bug report at
# http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.
#
# If you hand-edit the GDM configuration, you should run the following command
# to get the GDM daemon to recognize the change.  Any running GDM GUI programs
# will also be notified to update with the new configuration.
#
# gdmflexiserver --command="UPDATE_CONFIG <configuration key>"
#
# e.g, the "Enable" key in the "[debug]" section would be "debug/Enable".
#
# You can also run gdm-restart or gdm-safe-restart to cause GDM to restart and
# re-read the new configuration settings.  You can also restart GDM by sending
# a HUP or USR1 signal to the daemon.  HUP behaves like gdm-restart and causes
# any user session started by GDM to exit immediately while USR1 behaves like
# gdm-safe-restart and will wait until all users log out before restarting GDM.

# started.  The key for each entry must be a unique number that cooresponds to
# the DISPLAY number to start the X server.  For a typical single-display
# machine, there will only be one entry "0" for DISPLAY ":0".  The first word
# in the value corresponds to an X server definition in the "X Server
# Definitions" section of the configuration file.  For example, the entry:
#
# 0=Standard
#
# Means that DISPLAY ":0" will start an X server as defined in the 
# [server-Standard] section.
#
# The optional device argument is used to specify the device that is associated
# with the DISPLAY.  When using Virtual Terminals (VT), this value is ignored
# and GDM will use the correct device name associated with the VT.  If not
# using VT, then GDM will use the value specified by this optional argument.
# If the device argument is not defined, then GDM will use the default setting
# for attached displays defined in the UtmpLineAttached configuration option.
# For the main display (typically DISPLAY ":0"), "/dev/console" is a reasonable
# value.  For other displays it is probably best to not include this argument
# unless you know the specific device associated with the DISPLAY.  The device
# value can contain "%d" which is translated to the DISPLAY value or %h which
# is translated to the hostname.
#
0=Standard device=/dev/console

# Example of how to set up DISPLAY :1 to also use Standard.
#1=Standard

# If you wish to run the XDMCP chooser on the local display use the following
# line
#0=Chooser

# X Server Definitions
#
# Note: Is your X server not listening to TCP requests?  Refer to the 
# security/DisallowTCP setting!

[server-Standard]
name=Standard server
command=/usr/bin/Xorg -audit 0
flexible=true
# Indicates that the X server should be started at a different process
# priority.  Values can be any integer value accepted by the setpriority C
# library function (normally between -20 and 20) with 0 being the default. For
# highly interactive applications, -5 yields good responsiveness. The default
# value is 0 and the setpriority function is not called if the value is 0.

#priority=0

# To use this server type you should add -query host or -indirect host to the
# command line.
[server-Terminal]
name=Terminal server
# Add -terminate to make things behave more nicely
command=/usr/bin/Xorg -audit 0 -terminate
# Make this not appear in the flexible servers (we need extra params anyway,
# and terminate would be bad for xdmcp choosing).  You can make a terminal
# server flexible, but not with an indirect query.  If you need flexible
# indirect query server, then you must get rid of the -terminate and the only
# way to kill the flexible server will then be by Ctrl-Alt-Backspace.
flexible=false
# Do not handle this X server for attached displays.
handled=false

# To use this server type you should add -query host or -indirect host to the
# command line.
[server-Chooser]
name=Chooser server
command=/usr/bin/Xorg -audit 0
# Make this not appear in the flexible servers for now, but if you wish to
# allow a chooser server then make this true.  This is the only way to make a
# flexible chooser server that behaves nicely.
flexible=false
# Run the chooser instead of the greeter.  When the user chooses a machine they
# will get this same server but run with "-terminate -query hostname".
chooser=true

[customcommand]
# This section allows you specify up to 10 custom commands. Each of the
# commands can be defined by the seven parameters listed below. In each of the
# descriptions of the parameters N can take on any values between 0 and 9,
# i.e. CustomCommand0=,CustomCommand1=,...,CustomCommand9=.  The  numbers
# can have gaps as long as they fit within predefined set of 10, and their
# placement order within this section and with respect to each other is
# not important.
#
# CustomCommandN, CustomCommandTextN, CustomCommandLabelN, 
# CustomCommandLRLabelN, CustomCommandTooltipN, CustomCommandIsPersistentN
# and CustomCommandNoRestartN should all be defined for a given integer N, 
# where N can be a number from 0-9 (if not the default values will be 
# assigned except CustomCommandN for which no default exists).

# Custom command to run.  Multiple commands may be specified separated by 
# semicolons.  GDM will use the first valid command.  Examples:
# /sbin/bootwindoze;/usr/bin/bootwindoze, or
# /sbin/runupdate;/usr/local/sbin/runupdate
#
#CustomCommandN=

# Custom command dialog message that will appear on all warning dialogs.
# This will vary depending on what you want to do. Examples:
# Are you sure you want to restart system into Windoze?, or
# Are you sure you want do do this?
#CustomCommandTextN=

# Custom command label that will appear as stock label on buttons/menu items.
# This option can't contain any semicolon characters (i.e. ";").
# Examples:
# _Windoze, or
# _Update Me
#CustomCommandLabelN=

# Custom command label that will appear as stock label on radio buttons/list
# items.  The underscore indicates the mnemonic used with this item.  Examples:
#   Restart into _Windoze
#   Perform system _Update
#CustomCommandLRLabelN=

# Custom command tooltip. Examples
# Restarts the computer into Windoze
# Updates the computer software to the most recent version(s)
#CustomCommandTooltipN=

# Custom command persistence option. Setting it to true will allow this
# command to appear outside the login manager, e.g. on the desktop through 
# Log Out/Shut Down dialogs. The default value is false.
#CustomCommandIsPersistentN=

# Custom command gdm/system restart option. Setting it to true will not
# restart gdm after command execution.  The default commands (reboot, shut
# down) all reboot the system by default which is why the default setting
# is true.
# In addition when corresponding CustomCommandIsPersistentN option is set to
# true, setting CustomCommandNoRestartN to false will place CustomCommandN
# in the Shut Down dialog set of actions, setting it to true will place
# CustomCommandN in the Log Out dialog set of actions.
#CustomCommandNoRestartN=
#
# Example layout for more than one command:
#CustomCommand0=
