/* jack-dssi-host.c
 *
 * DSSI Soft Synth Interface
 *
 * This is a host for DSSI plugins.  It listens for MIDI events on an
 * ALSA sequencer port, delivers them to DSSI synths and outputs the
 * result via JACK.
 *
 * This program expects the names of up to 16 DSSI synth plugins, in
 * the form '<dll-name>:<label>',* to be provided on the command line.
 * If just '<dll-name>' is provided, the first plugin in the DLL is
 * is used.  MIDI channels are assigned to each plugin instance, in
 * order, beginning with channel 0 (zero-based).  A plugin may be
 * easily instantiated multiple times by preceding its name and label
 * with a dash followed immediately by the desired number of instances,
 * e.g. '-3 my_plugins.so:zoomy' would create three instances of the
 * 'zoomy' plugin.
