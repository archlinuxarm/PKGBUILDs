Hello,

I consulted with our attorney and despite the language in our Terms of
Service related to various IP rights, the Signal code is explicitly
licensed under GPLv3. As long as your company complies with the GPLv3, your
use and distribution of Signal Desktop is explicitly permitted under GPLv3.

We do ask that you use reasonable efforts to make timely updates to your
repository to the most current version of Signal as it becomes available.

Please let me know if you have any questions. All the best to you and your
organization.

Thanks.
-aruna
