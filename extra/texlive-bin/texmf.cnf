% texmf.cnf for TeXLive/Arch Linux -- runtime path configuration file for kpathsea.
% Public domain.
% 
% What follows is a super-summary of what this .cnf file can
% contain. Please read the Kpathsea manual for more information.
%
% Any identifier (sticking to A-Za-z_ for names is safest) can be assigned.
% The `=' (and surrounding spaces) is optional.
% $foo (or ${foo}) in a value expands to the envvar or cnf value of foo.
% Long lines can be continued with a \.
%
% Earlier entries (in the same or another file) override later ones, and
% an environment variable foo overrides any texmf.cnf definition of foo.
%
% All definitions are read before anything is expanded, so you can use
% variables before they are defined.
%
% If a variable assignment is qualified with `.PROGRAM', it is ignored
% unless the current executable (last filename component of argv[0]) is
% named PROGRAM.  This foo.PROGRAM construct is not recognized on the
% right-hand side. For environment variables, use FOO_PROGRAM.
%
% Which file formats use which paths for searches is described in the
% various programs' and the Kpathsea documentation (http://tug.org/kpathsea).
%
% // means to search subdirectories (recursively).
% A leading !! means to look only in the ls-R db, never on the disk.
% In this file, either ; or : can be used to separate path components.
% A leading/trailing/doubled path separator in the paths will be
%   expanded into the compile-time default. Probably not what you want.
%

% Brace notation is supported, for example: /usr/local/{mytex,othertex}
% expands to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  You can use the path
% separator as well as the comma for this: /usr/local/{mytex:othertex}
% also expands to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex.  We make
% extensive use of this.

%  Part 1: Search paths and directories.

% You can set an environment variable to override TEXMF if you're testing
% a new TeX tree, without changing anything else.
%
% You may wish to use one of the $SELFAUTO... variables here so TeX will
% find where to look dynamically.  See the manual and the definition
% below of TEXMFCNF.

% The tree containing the runtime files closely related to the specific
% program version used:
TEXMFMAIN = /usr/share/texmf

% The main distribution tree:
TEXMFDIST = /usr/share/texmf-dist

% Our documentation-only tree, arranged by language:
TEXMFDOC = /usr/share/texmf-doc

% A place for local additions to a "standard" texmf tree.
% This tree is not used for local configuration maintained by
% texconfig, it uses TEXMFCONFIG below.
TEXMFLOCAL = /usr/local/share/texmf

% TEXMFSYSVAR, where texconfig-sys stores variable runtime data.
TEXMFSYSVAR = /var/lib/texmf

% TEXMFSYSCONFIG, where texconfig-sys stores configuration data.
TEXMFSYSCONFIG = /etc/texmf

% User texmf trees are allowed as follows.
TEXMFHOME = ~/texmf

% TEXMFVAR, where texconfig stores variable runtime data.
TEXMFVAR = ~/.texlive/texmf-var

% TEXMFCONFIG, where texconfig stores configuration data.
TEXMFCONFIG = ~/.texlive/texmf-config

% Now, list all the texmf trees. If you have multiple trees you can
% use shell brace notation, like this:
%   TEXMF = {$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
% The braces are necessary.
%
% For texconfig to work properly, TEXMFCONFIG and TEXMFVAR should be named
% explicitly and before all other trees.
% 
% TEXMFLOCAL follows TEXMFMAIN (and precedes TEXMFDIST) because the
% files in TEXMFMAIN are tightly coupled with the particular version of
% the distribution, such as format files.  Overriding them would be more
% likely to cause trouble than help.  On the other hand, all the
% standard packages and fonts are in TEXMFDIST, and locally-installed
% versions should take precedence over those (although it is generally a
% source of confusion to have different versions of a package installed,
% whatever the trees, so try to avoid it).
TEXMF = {$TEXMFCONFIG,$TEXMFVAR,$TEXMFHOME,!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

% Where to look for ls-R files.  There need not be an ls-R in the
% directories in this path, but if there is one, Kpathsea will use it.
% By default, this is only the !! elements of TEXMF, so that mktexlsr
% does not create ls-R files in the non-!! elements -- because if an
% ls-R is present, it will be used, and the disk will not be searched.
% This is arguably a bug in kpathsea.
TEXMFDBS = {!!$TEXMFSYSCONFIG,!!$TEXMFSYSVAR,!!$TEXMFMAIN,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFDIST}

% The system trees.  These are the trees that are shared by all the users.
% If a tree appears in this list, the mktex* scripts will use
% VARTEXFONTS for generated files, if the original tree isn't writable;
% otherwise the current working directory is used.
SYSTEXMF = $TEXMFSYSVAR;$TEXMFMAIN;$TEXMFLOCAL;$TEXMFDIST

% Where generated fonts may be written.  This tree is used when the sources
% were found in a system tree and either that tree wasn't writable, or the
% varfonts feature was enabled in MT_FEATURES in mktex.cnf.
VARTEXFONTS = $TEXMFVAR/fonts

% On some systems, there will be a system tree which contains all the font
% files that may be created as well as the formats.  For example
%   TEXMFVAR = /var/lib/texmf
% is used in many distros.  In this case, set VARTEXFONTS like this
% VARTEXFONTS = $TEXMFVAR/fonts
% and do not mention it in TEXMFDBS (but _do_ mention TEXMFVAR).
%
% Remove $VARTEXFONTS from TEXMFDBS if the VARTEXFONTS directory is below
% one of the TEXMF directories (avoids overlapping ls-R files).

%

%
% This setting only affects names being looked up which *already* have

% always have an extension added first.

% to existing fmt files, increase extra_mem_*.  (To get an idea of how
% much, try \tracingstats=2 in your TeX source file;
% web2c/tests/memtest.tex might also be interesting.)
%
% To increase space for boxes (as might be needed by, e.g., PiCTeX),
% increase extra_mem_bot.
%
% For some xy-pic samples, you may need as much as 700000 words of memory.
