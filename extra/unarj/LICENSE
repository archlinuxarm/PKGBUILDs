     UNARJ LICENSE POLICY FOR ALL USERS:

     The UNARJ program, source code, and the associated documentation
     are copyright (c) 1990-2000 ARJ Software, Inc. all rights reserved.

     If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
     distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

     README.DOC
     UNARJ.EXE
     UNARJ.DOC
     UNARJ.C
     DECODE.C
     ENVIRON.C
     UNARJ.H
     UNARJ.DEF
     TCCUNARJ.MAK
     BCCUNARJ.MAK
     BCC32.MAK
     QCLUNARJ.MAK
     OS2UNARJ.MAK
     TECHNOTE.DOC

     We strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
     originally released:  UNARJ243.EXE with the ARJ-SECURITY envelope as
     created by the author.  If you must distribute the UNARJ archive in
     another archive format, please archive the UNARJ243.EXE as one file
     inside the other archive.  Re-archival of the software as separate
     files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

     You may freely use the UNARJ C source code.  If you wish to 
     distribute a modified version of UNARJ.EXE, you MUST indicate that it 
     is a modified version both in the program and source code.

     We are holding the copyright on the source code, so please do not
     delete our name from the program files or the documentation.

     The UNARJ.EXE program is built from this source using Borland C++ 3.1.

     You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ.EXE, provided that no
     fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

     You may use UNARJ.EXE in a commercial software package provided that
     no additional fee is charged for using UNARJ.EXE and provided that
     the user fully understands that NO warranty or support is provided
     for UNARJ.EXE by ARJ Software.  Moreover, the user must fully
     understand that UNARJ does not have the long usage history that ARJ
     does.

     This source code is intended to promote the building of utilities to
     support the use of ARJ and ARJ archives.
