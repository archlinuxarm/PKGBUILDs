Roman Czyborra released his work (Perl scripts and font .hex files)
under the following terms:

     All of my works you find here are freeware. You may
     freely copy, use, quote, modify or redistribute them
     as long as you properly attribute my contribution and
     have given a quick thought about whether Roman might
     perhaps be interested to read what you did with his
     stuff. Horizontal rules don't apply.

David Starner released what in this package is named "hex2bdf-split"
under the same license as Roman Czyborra's work.

License for all of Paul Hardy's work (except "johab2ucs2" and
"blanks.hex", mentioned separately), Makefile and debian/ mods
by Anthony Fok, and modified software from Luis Gonzalez Miranda
(with permission granted to Paul Hardy):

     These are released under the terms of the GNU General Public
     License version 2, or (at your option) a later version.

License for Fonts:

     Any fonts using glyphs from the "wqy-cjk.hex" file (including
     the default TrueType font) are bound by the terms of the Wen
     Quan Yi font license.  Those fonts are released under the terms
     of the GNU General Public License (GPL) versionn 2, with the
     exception that embedding the font in a document does not by
     itself bind that document to the terms of the GNU GPL.

     Any fonts that do not use glyphs from the "wqy-cjk.hex" file
     fall under the above "License for all of Roman Czyborra's work".

     The fonts in "./font/precompiled" do use wqy-cjk.hex, and so
     are licensed under the GNU GPL version 2, with the exception
     that embedding the font in a document does not in itself bind
     that document to the terms of the GNU GPL.  The following
     paragraphs explaining the exception is taken from the Wen
     Quan Yi font distribution:

          ** GPL v2.0 license with font embedding exception:

          As a special exception, if you create a document which
          uses this font, and embed this font or unaltered portions
          of this font into the document, this font does not by
          itself cause the resulting document to be covered by
          the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
          however invalidate any other reasons why the document
          might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
          If you modify this font, you may extend this exception
          to your version of the font, but you are not obligated
          to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
          exception statement from your version.

License for "blanks.hex":

     There is one exception to the above rules: Paul Hardy earlier
     released the "blanks.hex" file into the public domain.
