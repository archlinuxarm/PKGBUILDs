To make a system for gth that actually works ;-)
the variable TBASE needs to be set to 0,1 or 2
depending on location where image is supposed to
be started from.
E.g. make TBASE=1

0: Start from RAM, base 0

1: Start from flash_base + 0x10070

2: Start from flash_base + 0x30070

When using 1 or 2, the image is supposed to be launched
from miniboot that boots the first U-Boot image found in
flash.
For miniboot code, description, see www.opensource.se
