### Pogoplug/DockStar mtd3 Bootloader ###

I guess this can be called version 2.0, because I lost the
source for what we currently have on PlugApps.

This is the mtd3 bootloader that enables booting from USB
on the Pogoplug and DockStars.

It's very-slightly modified, and credit for this goes to
aholler, who documented this at http://ahsoftware.de/dockstar
