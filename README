This git repository hosts PKGBUILDs and information
on porting Arch Linux (http://archlinux.org) to the
ARM platform, with an emphasis on the Marvell Kirkwood
and Sheeva platforms (armv5te or higher). However, it runs
on anything armv5tel or higher.

The packages are meant to be built on Plugbox Linux, found at
http://plugboxlinux.org

It's not called Arch-[something] due to copyright, but it's
basically Arch Linux for ARM.
