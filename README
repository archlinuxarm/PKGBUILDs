pkgbuilds.git - README - 05/18/2011
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This git repository hosts PKGBUILDs that have been modified from the upstream
Arch Linux (http://archlinux.org) release in order to build on the ARMv5te and
ARMv7-a architectures supported by Arch Linux ARM.  The distribution follows the
same repository structure and uses the pacman package manager.

The aur folder contains a small selection of packages that have been requested
by the community to be pre-compiled and easily installed.  However, you're free
to use the AUR just as you would on Arch, and we have included Yaourt to compile
and install directly from AUR (yaourt -AS packagename).

These packages are meant to be built on Arch Linux ARM, found at
http://archlinuxarm.org
