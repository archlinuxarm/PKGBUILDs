This git repository will host a few PKGBUILDs and information
on porting Arch Linux (http://archlinux.org) to the
Marvell Sheevaplug platform (ARM-based).

The packages are meant to be built on PlugBox Linux, found at
http://plugapps.com/

=============================================================

This repository also hosts tools necessary to run the
my.pogoplug.com (XCE) and other files. This is not piracy
for 2 reasons:

1. XCE and TUN are GPL-licensed.

2. You cannot run the XCE module on regular u-Boot on other devices,
and need a unique, verified ID and serial number written in the
bootloader. Also, MAC addresses are checked by my.pogoplug.com to
match the Cloud Engines family of plugs.
