pkgbuilds.git - README - 03/15/2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This git repository hosts PKGBUILDs that have been modified from the upstream
Arch Linux (http://archlinux.org) release in order to build on the ARMv5te and
ARMv7-a architectures supported by Arch Linux ARM.  The distribution follows the
same repository structure and uses the pacman package manager.

The aur folder contains a small selection of packages that have been requested
by the community to be pre-compiled and easily installed.  However, you're free
to use the AUR just as you would on Arch, and we have included Yaourt to compile
and install directly from AUR (yaourt -AS packagename).

The alarm folder contains packages we have created or that have been submitted
to us to enable functionality on ARM systems in use by the community.  These are
packages that are not available in either upstream or AUR.

These packages are meant to be built on Arch Linux ARM, found at
http://archlinuxarm.org

Layout:
  core, extra, community: These folders contain packages only found in the
    upstream repositories by the same name.  Exceptions are packages such as our
    kernels or other packages we feel belong within the scope of these repos.
  aur: Contains packages that come from only from the AUR.
  alarm: Contains packages that are our own, or changed significantly enough
    from upstream or AUR to no longer qualify as being in those respective
    locations here.

New packages should be placed in the correct locations, with the packages base
folder name reflecting the 'pkgname' for single-package PKGBUILDs, or 'pkgbase'
for multiple-package PKGBUILDs.  In the case of non-alarm packages, naming should
exactly match the base folder or package name as used upstream or in the AUR,
respectively.  This will ensure correct package->version matching in the build
system update routines.
