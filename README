plugapps.git - README - 03/23/2011

This git repository hosts PKGBUILDs and information
on porting Arch Linux (http://archlinux.org) to the
ARM platform, with an emphasis on the Marvell Kirkwood
and Sheeva platforms (armv5te or higher). However, it runs
on anything armv5tel or higher.

The packages are meant to be built on PlugApps Linux, found at
http://plugapps.com

It's not called Arch-[something] due to copyright, but it's
basically Arch Linux for ARM. It follows the same repository
structure and uses the "pacman" package manager.

All packages are built using PKGBUILDs from the ABS, but the
ones hosted in this git repository have been modified, either
to make them compatible with the ARM architecture, or for branding.

The "aur" folder contains a small selection of packages we
believe should be pre-compiled and easily-installable.
But, you're free to use the AUR just as you would on Arch, and we
even included Yaourt (yaourt -AS aurpackage) to install directly
from AUR.
