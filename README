This git repository hosts PKGBUILDs and information
on porting Arch Linux (http://archlinux.org) to the
ARM platform, with an emphasis on the Marvell Kirkwood
and Sheeva platforms (armv5te or higher).

The packages are meant to be built on Plugbox Linux, found at
http://plugapps.com/

Also included is the Pogoplug/Dockstar "Advanced" u-Boot 
bootloader with USB drive boot support.

It's not called Arch-[something] due to copyright, but it's
basically Arch Linux for ARM.
