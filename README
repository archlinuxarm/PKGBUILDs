Kurlon's Sandbox - 5/31/2012
These pkgbuilds have been tweaked specifically for my GoFlex Net setup,
focusing specifically on improved Displaylink and zram performance to enhance
the GFN's functionality as a full desktop workstation.

Currently changed/new packages:
* core/linux - based on 3.4, requires updated uboot to function and modified 
LDFLAGS to boot
* aur/libdlo - Required for xf86 displaylink driver
* aur/xf86-video-displaylink

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This git repository hosts PKGBUILDs that have been modified from the upstream
Arch Linux (http://archlinux.org) release in order to build on the ARMv5te and
ARMv7-a architectures supported by Arch Linux ARM.  The distribution follows the
same repository structure and uses the pacman package manager.

The aur folder contains a small selection of packages that have been requested
by the community to be pre-compiled and easily installed.  However, you're free
to use the AUR just as you would on Arch, and we have included Yaourt to compile
and install directly from AUR (yaourt -AS packagename).

The alarm folder contains packages we have created or that have been submitted
to us to enable functionality on ARM systems in use by the community.  These are
packages that are not available in either upstream or AUR.

These packages are meant to be built on Arch Linux ARM, found at
http://archlinuxarm.org

Layout:
  core, extra, community: These folders contain packages only found in the
    upstream repositories by the same name.  Exceptions are packages such as our
    kernels or other packages we feel belong within the scope of these repos.
  aur: Contains packages that come from only from the AUR.
  alarm: Contains packages that are our own, or changed significantly enough
    from upstream or AUR to no longer qualify as being in those respective
    locations here.

New packages should be placed in the correct locations, with the packages base
folder name reflecting the 'pkgname' for single-package PKGBUILDs, or 'pkgbase'
for multiple-package PKGBUILDs.  In the case of non-alarm packages, naming should
exactly match the base folder or package name as used upstream or in the AUR,
respectively.  This will ensure correct package->version matching in the build
system update routines.

Custom PKGBUILD variables for the build system:
  noautobuild - if non-zero, the build system will mark the package as done and
    not build it for any architecture.
  buildarch - a bitmask of architectures to build the package for.  This must be
    set to the decimal equivalent of the bitmask (the number in parenthesis).
    - 0001 (1) = the default, package will be built for all architectures
    - 0010 (2) = the package will be built only for armv5
    - 0100 (4) = the package will be built only for armv7
